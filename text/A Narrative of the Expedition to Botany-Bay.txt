A NARRATIVE OF THE EXPEDITION TO BOTANY BAY


by Watkin Tench




INTRODUCTION



In offering this little tract to the public, it is equally the writer's
wish to conduce to their amusement and information.

The expedition on which he is engaged has excited much curiosity, and
given birth to many speculations, respecting the consequences to arise
from it. While men continue to think freely, they will judge variously.
Some have been sanguine enough to foresee the most beneficial effects to
the Parent State, from the Colony we are endeavouring to establish;
and some have not been wanting to pronounce the scheme big with folly,
impolicy, and ruin. Which of these predictions will be completed, I
leave to the decision of the public. I cannot, however, dismiss the
subject without expressing a hope, that the candid and liberal of each
opinion, induced by the humane and benevolent intention in which it
originated, will unite in waiting the result of a fair trial to an
experiment, no less new in its design, than difficult in its execution.

As this publication enters the world with the name of the author,
candour will, he trusts, induce its readers to believe, that no
consideration could weigh with him in an endeavour to mislead them.
Facts are related simply as they happened, and when opinions are
hazarded, they are such as, he hopes, patient inquiry, and deliberate
decision, will be found to have authorised. For the most part he has
spoken from actual observation; and in those places where the relations
of others have been unavoidably adopted. He has been careful to search
for the truth, and repress that spirit of exaggeration which is almost
ever the effect of novelty on ignorance.

The nautical part of the work is comprized in as few pages as possible.
By the professional part of my readers this will be deemed judicious;
and the rest will not, I believe, be dissatisfied at its brevity. I beg
leave, however, to say of the astronomical calculations, that they
may be depended on with the greatest degree of security, as they were
communicated by an officer, who was furnished with instruments, and
commissioned by the Board of Longitude, to make observations during the
voyage, and in the southern hemisphere.

An unpractised writer is generally anxious to bespeak public attention,
and to solicit public indulgence. Except on professional subjects,
military men are, perhaps, too fearful of critical censure. For the
present narrative no other apology is attempted, than the intentions of
its author, who has endeavoured not only to satisfy present curiosity,
but to point out to future adventurers, the favourable, as well as
adverse circumstances which will attend their settling here. The candid,
it is hoped, will overlook the inaccuracies of this imperfect sketch,
drawn amidst the complicated duties of the service in which the Author
is engaged, and make due allowance for the want of opportunity of
gaining more extensive information.

Watkin Tench, Capt. of the Marines.

Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, New South Wales, 10 July, 1788.





CHAPTER I



From the Embarkation of the Convicts, to the Departure of the Ships from
England.


The marines and convicts having been previously embarked in the River,
at Portsmouth, and Plymouth, the whole fleet destined for the expedition
rendezvoused at the Mother Bank, on the 16th of March 1787, and remained
there until the 13th of May following. In this period, excepting a
slight appearance of contagion in one of the transports, the ships were
universally healthy, and the prisoners in high spirits. Few complaints
or lamentations were to be heard among them, and an ardent wish for the
hour of departure seemed generally to prevail.

As the reputation, equally with the safety of the officers and
soldiers appointed to guard the convicts, consisted in maintaining due
subordination, an opportunity was taken, immediately on their being
embarked, to convince them, in the most pointed terms, that any attempt
on their side, either to contest the command, or to force their escape,
should be punished with instant death; orders to this effect were given
to the centinels in their presence; happily, however, for all parties,
there occurred not any instance in which there was occasion to have
recourse to so desperate a measure; the behavior of the convicts being
in general humble, submissive, and regular: indeed I should feel myself
wanting in justice to those unfortunate men, were I not to bear this
public testimony of the sobriety and decency of their conduct.

Unpleasant as a state of inactivity and delay for many weeks appeared
to us, it was not without its advantages; for by means of it we were
enabled to establish necessary regulations among the convicts, and to
adopt such a system of defence, as left us little to Apprehend for our
own security, in case a spirit of madness and desperation had hurried
them on to attempt our destruction.

Among many other troublesome parts of duty which the service we were
engaged on required, the inspection of all letters brought to, or sent
from the ships, was not one of the least tiresome and disagreeable. The
number and contents of those in the vessel I was embarked in, frequently
surprised me very much; they varied according to the dispositions of
the writers: but their constant language was, an apprehension of the
impracticability of returning home, the dread of a sickly passage,
and the fearful prospect of a distant and barbarous country. But this
apparent despondency proceeded in few instances from sentiment. With too
many it was, doubtless, an artifice to awaken compassion, and call forth
relief; the correspondence invariably ending in a petition for money
and tobacco. Perhaps a want of the latter, which is considered a great
luxury by its admirers among the lower classes of life, might be the
more severely felt, from their being debarred in all cases whatever,
sickness excepted, the use of spirituous liquors.

It may be thought proper for me to mention, that during our stay at the
Mother Bank, the soldiers and convicts were indiscriminately served
with fresh beef. The former, in addition, had the usual quantity of beer
allowed in the navy, and were at what is called full allowance of all
species of provisions; the latter, at two thirds only.




CHAPTER II.



From the Departure, to the Arrival of the Fleet at Teneriffe.


Governor Phillip having at length reached Portsmouth, and all things
deemed necessary for the expedition being put on board, at daylight
on the morning of the 13th, the signal to weigh anchor was made in the
Commanding Officer's ship the Sirius. Before six o'clock the whole
fleet were under sail; and, the weather being fine and wind easterly,
proceeded through the Needles with a fresh leading breeze. In addition
to our little armament, the Hyena frigate was ordered to accompany us
a certain distance to the westward, by which means our number was
increased to twelve sail: His Majesty's ships 'Sirius', 'Hyena', and
'Supply', three Victuallers with two years stores and provisions on
board for the Settlement, and six Transports, with troops and convicts.
In the transports were embarked four captains, twelve subalterns,
twenty-four serjeants and corporals, eight drummers, and one hundred and
sixty private marines, making the whole of the military force, including
the Major Commandant and Staff on board the Sirius, to consist of two
hundred and twelve persons, of whom two hundred and ten were volunteers.
The number of convicts was five hundred and sixty-five men, one hundred
and ninety-two women, and eighteen children; the major part of the
prisoners were mechanics and husbandmen, selected on purpose by order of
Government.

By ten o'clock we had got clear of the Isle of Wight, at which time,
having very little pleasure in conversing with my own thoughts, I
strolled down among the convicts, to observe their sentiments at this
juncture. A very few excepted, their countenances indicated a high
degree of satisfaction, though in some, the pang of being severed,
perhaps for ever, from their native land, could not be wholly
suppressed; in general, marks of distress were more perceptible among
the men than the women; for I recollect to have seen but one of those
affected on the occasion, "Some natural tears she dropp'd, but wip'd
them soon." After this the accent of sorrow was no longer heard; more
genial skies and change of scene banished repining and discontent, and
introduced in their stead cheerfulness and acquiescence in a lot, now
not to be altered.

To add to the good disposition which was beginning to manifest
itself, on the morning of the 20th, in consequence of some favorable
representations made by the officers commanding detachments, they were
hailed and told from the Sirius, that in those cases where they judged
it proper, they were at liberty to release the convicts from the fetters
in which they had been hitherto confined. In complying with these
directions, I had great pleasure in being able to extend this humane
order to the whole of those under my charge, without a single exception.
It is hardly necessary for me to say, that the precaution of ironing the
convicts at any time reached to the men only.

In the evening of the same day, the Hyena left us for England, which
afforded an early opportunity of writing to our friends, and easing
their apprehensions by a communication of the favourable accounts it was
in our power to send them.

From this time to the day of our making the land, little occurred worthy
of remark. I cannot, however, help noticing the propriety of employing
the marines on a service which requires activity and exertion at sea, in
preference to other troops. Had a regiment recruited since the war
been sent out, sea-sickness would have incapacitated half the men from
performing the duties immediately and indispensably necessary; whereas
the marines, from being accustomed to serve on board ship, accommodated
themselves with ease to every exigency, and surmounted every difficulty.

At daybreak, on the morning of the 30th of May we saw the rocks named
the Deserters, which lie off the south-east end of Madeira; and found
the south-east extremity of the most southerly of them, to be in the
latitude of 32 deg 28 min north, longitude 16 deg 17 1/2 min west of
Greenwich. The following day we saw the Salvages, a cluster of rocks
which are placed between the Madeiras and Canary Islands, and determined
the latitude of the middle of the Great Salvage to be 30 deg 12 min
north, and the longitude of its eastern side to be 15 deg 39 min west.
It is no less extraordinary than unpardonable, that in some very modern
charts of the Atlantic, published in London, the Salvages are totally
omitted.

We made the island of Teneriffe on the 3d of June, and in the evening
anchored in the road of Santa Cruz, after an excellent passage of three
weeks from the day we left England.




CHAPTER III.



From the Fleet's Arrival at Teneriffe, to its Departure for Rio de
Janeiro, in the Brazils.


There is little to please a traveller at Teneriffe. He has heard wonders
of its celebrated Peak, but he may remain for weeks together at the town
of Santa Cruz without having a glimpse of it, and when its cloud-topped
head emerges, the chance is, that he feels disappointed, for, from the
point of view in which he sees it, the neighbouring mountains lessen its
effect very considerably. Excepting the Peak, the eye receives little
pleasure from the general face of the country, which is sterile and
uninviting to the last degree. The town, however, from its cheerful
white appearance, contrasted with the dreary brownness of the back
ground, makes not an unpleasing coup d'oeil. It is neither irregular in
its plan, nor despicable in its style of building; and the churches and
religious houses are numerous, sumptuous, and highly ornamented.

The morning of our arrival, as many officers as could be spared from the
different ships were introduced to the Marquis de Brancifort, Governor
of the Canary Islands, whose reception was highly flattering and polite.
His Excellency is a Sicilian by birth, and is most deservedly popular in
his government. He prefers residing at Teneriffe, for the conveniency
of frequent communication with Europe, to the Grand Canary, which is
properly the seat of power; and though not long fixed here, has already
found means to establish a manufactory in cotton, silk, and thread,
under excellent regulations, which employs more than sixty persons, and
is of infinite service to the common people. During our short stay we
had every day some fresh proof of his Excellency's esteem and attention,
and had the honour of dining with him, in a style of equal elegance and
splendor. At this entertainment the profusion of ices which appeared in
the desert was surprising, considering that we were enjoying them under
a sun nearly vertical. But it seems the caverns of the Peak, very far
below its summit, afford, at all seasons, ice in abundance.

The restless importunity of the beggars, and the immodesty of the lowest
class of women, are highly disgusting. From the number of his countrymen
to be found, an Englishman is at no loss for society. In the mercantile
houses established here, it is from gentlemen of this description that
any information is derived, for the taciturnity of the Spaniards is not
to be overcome in a short acquaintance, especially by Englishmen, whose
reserve falls little short of their own. The inland country is described
as fertile, and highly romantic; and the environs of the small town of
Laguza mentioned as particularly pleasant. Some of our officers who made
an excursion to it confirmed the account amply.

It should seem that the power of the Church, which has been so long
on the decline in Europe, is at length beginning to be shaken in the
colonies of the Catholic powers: some recent instances which have taken
place at Teneriffe, evince it very fully. Were not a stranger, however,
to be apprized of this, he would hardly draw the conclusion from his own
observations. The Bishop of these islands, which conjunctively form a
See, resides on the Grand Canary. He is represented as a man in years,
and of a character as amiable as exalted, extremely beloved both by
foreigners and those of his own church. The bishopric is valued at ten
thousand pounds per annum; the government at somewhat less than two.

In spite of every precaution, while we lay at anchor in the road, a
convict had the address, one night, to secrete himself on the deck, when
the rest were turned below; and after remaining quiet for some hours,
let himself down over the bow of the ship, and floated to a boat that
lay astern, into which he got, and cutting her adrift, suffered himself
to be carried away by the current, until at a sufficient distance to
be out of hearing, when he rowed off. This elopement was not discovered
till some hours after, when a search being made, and boats sent to the
different parts of the island, he was discovered in a small cove, to
which he had fled for refuge. On being questioned, it appeared he had
endeavoured to get himself received on board a Dutch East Indiaman in
the road; but being rejected there, he resolved on crossing over to
the Grand Canary, which is at the distance of ten leagues, and when
detected, was recruiting his strength in order to make the attempt. At
the same time that the boats of the fleet were sent on this pursuit,
information was given to the Spanish Governor of what had happened,
who immediately detached parties every way in order to apprehend the
delinquent.

Having remained a week at Teneriffe, and in that time completed our
stock of water, and taken on board wine, &c. early on the morning of
the 10th of June we weighed anchor, and stood out to sea with a light
easterly breeze. The shortness of our stay, and the consequent hurry,
prevented our increasing much any previous knowledge we might have had
of the place. For the information of those who may follow us on this
service, it may not, however, be amiss to state the little that will be
found of use to them.

The markets afford fresh meat, though it is neither plentiful nor good.
Fish is scarce; but poultry may be procured in almost any quantity, at
as cheap a rate as in the English sea-ports. Vegetables do not abound,
except pumpkins and onions, of which I advise all ships to lay in a
large stock. Milch goats are bought for a trifle, and easily procured.
Grapes cannot be scarce in their season; but when we were here, except
figs and excellent mulberries, no fruit was to be procured. Dry wines,
as the merchants term them, are sold from ten to fifteen pounds a pipe;
for the latter price, the very best, called the London Particular, may
be bought: sweet wines are considerably dearer. Brandy is also a cheap
article. I would not advise the voyager to depend on this place for
either his hogs or sheep. And he will do well to supply himself with
dollars before he quits England, to expend in the different ports he may
happen to touch at. Should he, however, have neglected this precaution,
let him remember when he discounts bills, or exchanges English money
here, not to receive his returns in quarter dollars, which will be
tendered to him, but altogether in whole ones, as he will find the
latter turn to better account than the former, both at Rio de Janeiro
and the Cape of Good Hope.

The latitude of the town of Santa Cruz is 28 deg 27 1/2 min north, the
longitude 16 deg 17 1/2 min west of Greenwich.




CHAPTER IV.



The Passage from Teneriffe to Rio de Janeiro, in the Brazils.


In sailing from Teneriffe to the south-east, the various and picturesque
appearances of the Peak are beautiful to the highest degree. The
stupendous height, which before was lost on the traveller, now strikes
him with awe and admiration, the whole island appearing one vast
mountain with a pyramidal top. As we proceeded with light winds, at an
easy rate, we saw it distinctly for three days after our departure,
and should have continued to see it longer, had not the haziness of the
atmosphere interrupted our view. The good people of Santa Cruz tell some
stories of the wonderful extent of space to be seen from the summit
of it, that would not disgrace the memoirs of the ever-memorable Baron
Munchausen.

On the 18th of June we saw the most northerly of the Cape de Verd
Islands, at which time the Commodore gave the fleet to understand, by
signal, that his intention was to touch at some of them. The following
day we made St. Jago, and stood in to gain an anchorage in Port Praya
Bay. But the baffling winds and lee current rendering it a matter of
doubt whether or not the ships would be able to fetch, the signal for
anchoring was hauled down, and the fleet bore up before the wind. In
passing along them we were enabled to ascertain the south end of the
Isle of Sal to be in 16 deg 40 min north latitude, and 23 deg 5 min west
longitude. The south end of Bonavista to be in 15 deg 57 min north, 23
deg 8 min west. The south end of the Isle of May in 15 deg 11 min north,
23 deg 26 min west; and the longitude of the fort, in the town of Port
Praya, to be 23 deg 36 1/2 min west of Greenwich.

By this time the weather, from the sun being so far advanced in the
northern tropic, was become intolerably hot, which, joined to the heavy
rains that soon after came on, made us very apprehensive for the health
of the fleet. Contrary, however, to expectation, the number of sick in
the ship I was embarked on was surprisingly small, and the rest of the
fleet were nearly as healthy. Frequent explosions of gunpowder, lighting
fires between decks, and a liberal use of that admirable antiseptic,
oil of tar, were the preventives we made use of against impure air; and
above all things we were careful to keep the men's bedding and wearing
apparel dry. As we advanced towards the Line, the weather grew gradually
better and more pleasant. On the 14th of July we passed the Equator, at
which time the atmosphere was as serene, and the temperature of the air
not hotter than in a bright summer day in England. From this period,
until our arrival on the American coast, the heats, the calms, and
the rains by which we had been so much incommoded, were succeeded by a
series of weather as delightful as it was unlooked for. At three o'clock
in the afternoon of the 2nd of August, the 'Supply', which had been
previously sent a-head on purpose, made the signal for seeing the land,
which was visible to the whole fleet before sunset, and proved to be
Cape Frio, in latitude 23 deg 5 min south, longitude 41 deg 40 1/4 min
west.

Owing to light airs we did not get a-breast of the city of St.
Sebastian, in the harbour of Rio de Janeiro, until the 7th of the month,
when we anchored about three quarters of a mile from the shore.




CHAPTER V.



From the Arrival of the Fleet at Rio de Janeiro, till its Departure for
the Cape of Good Hope; with some Remarks on the Brazils.


Brazil is a country very imperfectly known in Europe. The Portugueze,
from political motives, have been sparing in their accounts of it.
Whence our descriptions of it, in the geographical publications in
England, are drawn, I know not: that they are miserably erroneous and
defective, is certain.

The city of St. Sebastian stands on the west side of the harbour, in a
low unhealthy situation, surrounded on all sides by hills, which
stop the free circulation of air, and subject its inhabitants to
intermittents and putrid diseases. It is of considerable extent: Mr.
Cook makes it as large as Liverpool; but Liverpool, in 1767, when Mr.
Cook wrote, was not two-thirds of its present size. Perhaps it
equals Chester, or Exeter, in the share of ground it occupies, and is
infinitely more populous than either of them. The streets intersect each
other at right angles, are tolerably well built, and excellently paved,
abounding with shops of every kind, in which the wants of a stranger,
if money is not one of them, can hardly remain unsatisfied. About the
centre of the city, and at a little distance from the beach, the Palace
of the Viceroy stands, a long, low building, no wise remarkable in
its exterior appearance; though within are some spacious and handsome
apartments. The churches and convents are numerous, and richly
decorated; hardly a night passes without some of the latter being
illuminated in honour of their patron saints, which has a very brilliant
effect when viewed from the water, and was at first mistaken by us for
public rejoicings. At the corner of almost every street stands a little
image of the Virgin, stuck round with lights in an evening, before which
passengers frequently stop to pray and sing very loudly. Indeed, the
height to which religious zeal is carried in this place, cannot fail
of creating astonishment in a stranger. The greatest part of the
inhabitants seem to have no other occupation, than that of paying visits
and going to church, at which times you see them sally forth richly
dressed, en chapeau bras, with the appendages of a bag for the hair,
and a small sword: even boys of six years old are seen parading about,
furnished with these indispensable requisites. Except when at their
devotions, it is not easy to get a sight of the women, and when
obtained, the comparisons drawn by a traveller, lately arrived from
England, are little flattering to Portugueze beauty. In justice,
however, to the ladies of St. Sebastian, I must observe, that the custom
of throwing nosegays at strangers, for the purpose of bringing on an
assignation, which Doctor Solander, and another gentleman of Mr. Cook's
ship, met with when here, was never seen by any of us in a single
instance. We were so deplorably unfortunate as to walk every evening
before their windows and balconies, without being honoured with a single
bouquet, though nymphs and flowers were in equal and great abundance.

Among other public buildings, I had almost forgot to mention an
observatory, which stands near the middle of the town, and is tolerably
well furnished with astronomical instruments. During our stay here, some
Spanish and Portuguese mathematicians were endeavouring to determine
the boundaries of the territories belonging to their respective crowns.
Unhappily, however, for the cause of science, these gentleman have not
hitherto been able to coincide in their accounts, so that very little
information on this head, to be depended upon, could be gained. How far
political motives may have caused this disagreement, I do not presume to
decide; though it deserves notice, that the Portuguese accuse the Abbee
de la Caille, who observed here by order of the King of France, of
having laid down the longitude of this place forty-five miles too much
to the eastward.

Until the year 1770, all the flour in the settlement was brought
from Europe; but since that time the inhabitants have made so rapid a
progress in raising grain, as to be able to supply themselves with it
abundantly. The principal corn country lies around Rio Grande, in the
latitude of 32 deg south, where wheat flourishes so luxuriantly, as to
yield from seventy to eighty bushels for one. Coffee also, which they
formerly received from Portugal, now grows in such plenty as to enable
them to export considerable quantities of it. But the staple commodity
of the country is sugar. That they have not, however, learnt the art
of making palatable rum, the English troops in New South Wales can bear
testimony; a large quantity, very ill flavoured, having been bought and
shipped here for the use of the garrison of Port Jackson.

It was in 1771 that St. Salvador, which had for more than a century been
the capital of Brazil, ceased to be so; and that the seat of Government
was removed to St. Sebastian. The change took place on account of
the colonial war, at that time carried on by the Courts of Lisbon and
Madrid. And, indeed, were the object of security alone to determine
the seat of Government, I know but few places better situated in that
respect than the one I am describing; the natural strength of the
country, joined to the difficulties which would attend an attack on the
fortifications, being such as to render it very formidable.

It may be presumed that the Portuguese Government is well apprized of
this circumstance and of the little risque they run in being deprived
of so important a possession, else it will not be easy to penetrate the
reasons which induce them to treat the troops who compose the garrison
with such cruel negligence. Their regiments were ordered out with a
promise of being relieved, and sent back to Europe at the end of
three years, in conformity to which they settled all their domestic
arrangements. But the faith of Government has been broken, and at the
expiration of twenty years, all that is left to the remnant of these
unfortunate men, is to suffer in submissive silence. I was one evening
walking with a Portuguese officer, when this subject was started, and
on my telling him, that such a breach of public honour to English troops
would become a subject of parliamentary enquiry, he seized my hand
with great eagerness, "Ah, Sir!" exclaimed he, "yours is a free
country--we"!----His emotions spoke what his tongue refused.

As I am mentioning the army, I cannot help observing, that I saw nothing
here to confirm the remark of Mr. Cook, that the inhabitants of the
place, whenever they meet an officer of the garrison, bow to him with
the greatest obsequiousness; and by omitting such a ceremony, would
subject themselves to be knocked down, though the other seldom deigns to
return the compliment. The interchange of civilities is general between
them, and seems by no means extorted. The people who could submit to
such insolent superiority, would, indeed, deserve to be treated as
slaves.

The police of the city is very good. Soldiers patrole the streets
frequently, and riots are seldom heard of. The dreadful custom of
stabbing, from motives of private resentment, is nearly at an end,
since the church has ceased to afford an asylum to murderers. In other
respects, the progress of improvement appears slow, and fettered by
obstacles almost insurmountable, whose baneful influence will continue,
until a more enlightened system of policy shall be adopted. From morning
to night the ears of a stranger are greeted by the tinkling of the
convent bells, and his eyes saluted by processions of devotees, whose
adoration and levity seem to keep equal pace, and succeed each other in
turns. "Do you want to make your son sick of soldiering? Shew him the
Trainbands of London on a field-day." Let him who would wish to give his
son a distaste to Popery, point out to him the sloth, the ignorance, and
the bigotry of this place.

Being nearly ready to depart by the 1st of September, as many officers
as possible went on that day to the palace to take leave of his
Excellency, the Viceroy of the Brazils, to whom we had been previously
introduced; who on this, and every other occasion, was pleased to honour
us with the most distinguished marks of regard and attention. Some part,
indeed, of the numerous indulgencies we experienced during our stay
here, must doubtless be attributed to the high respect in which the
Portuguese held Governor Phillip, who was for many years a captain in
their navy, and commanded a ship of war on this station: in consequence
of which, many privileges were extended to us, very unusual to be
granted to strangers. We were allowed the liberty of making short
excursions into the country, and on these occasions, as well as when
walking in the city, the mortifying custom of having an officer of the
garrison attending us was dispensed with on our leaving our names
and ranks, at the time of landing, with the adjutant of orders at the
palace. It happened, however, sometimes, that the presence of a
military man was necessary to prevent imposition in the shopkeepers, who
frequently made a practice of asking more for their goods than the worth
of them. In which case an officer, when applied to, always told us the
usual price of the commodity with the greatest readiness, and adjusted
the terms of the purchase.

On the morning of the fourth of September we left Rio de Janeiro,
amply furnished with the good things which its happy soil and clime so
abundantly produce. The future voyager may with security depend on
this place for laying in many parts of his stock. Among these may be
enumerated sugar, coffee, rum, port wine, rice, tapioca, and tobacco,
besides very beautiful wood for the purposes of household furniture.
Poultry is not remarkably cheap, but may be procured in any quantity;
as may hops at a low rate. The markets are well supplied with butcher's
meat, and vegetables of every sort are to be procured at a price next to
nothing; the yams are particularly excellent. Oranges abound so much,
as to be sold for sixpence a hundred; and limes are to be had on terms
equally moderate. Bananas, cocoa nuts, and guavas, are common; but the
few pineapples brought to market are not remarkable either for
flavour, or cheapness. Besides the inducements to lay out money already
mentioned, the naturalist may add to his collection by an almost endless
variety of beautiful birds and curious insects, which are to be bought
at a reasonable price, well preserved, and neatly assorted.

I shall close my account of this place by informing strangers, who may
come here, that the Portuguese reckon their money in rees, an imaginary
coin, twenty of which make a small copper piece called a 'vintin', and
sixteen of these last a 'petack'. Every piece is marked with the number
of rees it is worth, so that a mistake can hardly happen. English silver
coin has lost its reputation here, and dollars will be found preferable
to any other money.




CHAPTER VI.



The Passage from the Brazils to the Cape of Good Hope; with an Account
of the Transactions of the Fleet there.


Our passage from Rio de Janeiro to the Cape of Good Hope was equally
prosperous with that which had preceded it. We steered away to the
south-east, and lost sight of the American coast the day after our
departure. From this time until the 13th of October, when we made the
Cape, nothing remarkable occurred, except the loss of a convict in the
ship I was on board, who unfortunately fell into the sea, and perished
in spite of our efforts to save him, by cutting adrift a life buoy and
hoisting out a boat. During the passage, a slight dysentery prevailed
in some of the ships, but was in no instance mortal. We were at first
inclined to impute it to the water we took on board at the Brazils, but
as the effect was very partial, some other cause was more probably the
occasion of it.

At seven o'clock in the evening of the 13th of October, we cast anchor
in Table Bay, and found many ships of different nations in the harbour.

Little can be added to the many accounts already published of the Cape
of Good Hope, though, if an opinion on the subject might be risqued, the
descriptions they contain are too flattering. When contrasted with Rio
de Janeiro, it certainly suffers in the comparison. Indeed we arrived at
a time equally unfavourable for judging of the produce of the soil and
the temper of its cultivators, who had suffered considerably from a
dearth that had happened the preceding season, and created a general
scarcity. Nor was the chagrin of these deprivations lessened by the news
daily arriving of the convulsions that shook the republic, which could
not fail to make an impression even on Batavian phlegm.

As a considerable quantity of flour, and the principal part of the live
stock, which was to store our intended settlement, were meant to be
procured here, Governor Phillip lost no time in waiting on Mynheer Van
Graaffe, the Dutch Governor, to request permission (according to the
custom of the place) to purchase all that we stood in need of. How far
the demand extended, I know not, nor Mynheer Van Graaffe's reasons for
complying with it in part only. To this gentleman's political sentiments
I confess myself a stranger; though I should do his politeness and
liberality at his own table an injustice, were I not to take this public
opportunity of acknowledging them; nor can I resist the opportunity
which presents itself, to inform my readers, in honor of M. Van
Graaffe's humanity, that he has made repeated efforts to recover the
unfortunate remains of the crew of the Grosvenor Indiaman, which was
wrecked about five years ago on the coast of Caffraria. This information
was given me by Colonel Gordon, commandant of the Dutch troops at the
Cape, whose knowledge of the interior parts of this country surpasses
that of any other man. And I am sorry to say that the Colonel added,
these unhappy people were irrecoverably lost to the world and their
friends, by being detained among the Caffres, the most savage set of
brutes on earth.

His Excellency resides at the Government house, in the East India
Company's garden. This last is of considerable extent, and is planted
chiefly with vegetables for the Dutch Indiamen which may happen to touch
at the port. Some of the walks are extremely pleasant from the shade
they afford, and the whole garden is very neatly kept. The regular lines
intersecting each other at right angles, in which it is laid out, will,
nevertheless, afford but little gratification to an Englishman, who
has been used to contemplate the natural style which distinguishes the
pleasure grounds of his own country. At the head of the centre walks
stands a menagerie, on which, as well as the garden, many pompous
eulogiums have been passed, though in my own judgment, considering the
local advantages possessed by the Company, it is poorly furnished
both with animals and birds; a tyger, a zebra, some fine ostriches, a
cassowary, and the lovely crown-fowl, are among the most remarkable.

The table land, which stands at the back of the town, is a black dreary
looking mountain, apparently flat at top, and of more than eleven
hundred yards in height. The gusts of wind which blow from it are
violent to an excess, and have a very unpleasant effect, by raising
the dust in such clouds, as to render stirring out of doors next to
impossible. Nor can any precaution prevent the inhabitants from being
annoyed by it, as much within doors as without.

At length the wished-for day, on which the next effort for reaching the
place of our destination was to be made, appeared. The morning was calm,
but the land wind getting up about noon, on the 12th of November we
weighed anchor, and soon left far behind every scene of civilization and
humanized manners, to explore a remote and barbarous land; and plant in
it those happy arts, which alone constitute the pre-eminence and dignity
of other countries.

The live animals we took on board on the public account from the Cape,
for stocking our projected colony, were, two bulls, three cows, three
horses, forty-four sheep, and thirty-two hogs, besides goats, and a very
large quantity of poultry of every kind. A considerable addition to this
was made by the private stocks of the officers, who were, however, under
a necessity of circumscribing their original intentions on this head
very much, from the excessive dearness of many of the articles. It will
readily be believed, that few of the military found it convenient to
purchase sheep, when hay to feed them costs sixteen shillings a hundred
weight.

The boarding-houses on shore, to which strangers have recourse, are more
reasonable than might be expected. For a dollar and a half per day
we were well lodged, and partook of a table tolerably supplied in the
French style. Should a traveller's stock of tea run short, it is a
thousand chances to one that he will be able to replenish it here at a
cheaper rate than in England. He may procure plenty of arrack and white
wine; also raisins, and dried fruits of other sorts. If he dislikes to
live at a boarding-house, he will find the markets well stored, and the
price of butcher's meat and vegetables far from excessive.

Just before the signal for weighing was made, a ship, under American
colours, entered the road, bound from Boston, from whence she had sailed
one hundred and forty days, on a trading voyage to the East Indies. In
her route, she had been lucky enough to pick up several of the inferior
officers and crew of the Harcourt East-Indiaman, which ship had been
wrecked on one of the Cape de Verd Islands. The master, who appeared
to be a man of some information, on being told the destination of our
fleet, gave it as his opinion, that if a reception could be secured,
emigrations would take place to New South Wales, not only from the old
continent, but the new one, where the spirit of adventure and thirst for
novelty were excessive.




CHAPTER VII.



The Passage from the Cape of Good Hope to Botany Bay.


We had hardly cleared the land when a south-east wind set in, and,
except at short intervals, continued to blow until the 19th of the
month; when we were in the latitude of 37 deg 40 min south, and by the
time-keeper, in longitude 11 deg 30 min east, so that our distance from
Botany Bay had increased nearly an hundred leagues since leaving the
Cape. As no appearance of a change in our favour seemed likely to take
place, Governor Phillip at this time signified his intention of shifting
his pennant from the Sirius to the 'Supply', and proceeding on his
voyage without waiting for the rest of the fleet, which was formed in
two divisions. The first consisting of three transports, known to be the
best sailors, was put under the command of a Lieutenant of the navy;
and the remaining three, with the victuallers, left in charge of Captain
Hunter, of his Majesty's ship Sirius. In the last division was the
vessel, in which the author of this narrative served. Various causes
prevented the separation from taking place until the 25th, when several
sawyers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and other mechanics, were shifted
from different ships into the 'Supply', in order to facilitate his
Excellency's intention of forwarding the necessary buildings to be
erected at Botany Bay, by the time the rest of the fleet might be
expected to arrive. Lieutenant Governor Ross, and the Staff of the
marine battalion, also removed from the Sirius into the Scarborough
transport, one of the ships of the first division, in order to afford
every assistance which the public service might receive, by their being
early on the spot on which our future operations were to be conducted.

From this time a succession of fair winds and pleasant weather
corresponded to our eager desires, and on the 7th of January, 1788, the
long wished for shore of Van Diemen gratified our sight. We made the
land at two o'clock in the afternoon, the very hour we expected to see
it from the lunar observations of Captain Hunter, whose accuracy, as
an astronomer, and conduct as an officer, had inspired us with equal
gratitude and admiration.

After so long a confinement, on a service so peculiarly disgusting and
troublesome, it cannot be matter of surprise that we were overjoyed at
the near prospect of a change of scene. By sunset we had passed between
the rocks, which Captain Furneaux named the Mewstone and Swilly.
The former bears a very close resemblance to the little island near
Plymouth, whence it took its name: its latitude is 43 deg 48 min south,
longitude 146 deg 25 min east of Greenwich.

In running along shore, we cast many an anxious eye towards the land,
on which so much of our future destiny depended. Our distance, joined to
the haziness of the atmosphere, prevented us, however, from being able
to discover much. With our best glasses we could see nothing but hills
of a moderate height, cloathed with trees, to which some little patches
of white sandstone gave the appearance of being covered with snow. Many
fires were observed on the hills in the evening.

As no person in the ship I was on board had been on this coast before,
we consulted a little chart, published by Steele, of the Minories,
London, and found it, in general, very correct; it would be more so,
were not the Mewstone laid down at too great a distance from the land,
and one object made of the Eddystone and Swilly, when, in fact, they
are distinct. Between the two last is an entire bed of impassable rocks,
many of them above water. The latitude of the Eddystone is 43 deg 53
1/2 min, longitude 147 deg 9 min; that of Swilly 43 deg 54 min south,
longitude 147 deg 3 min east of Greenwich.

In the night the westerly wind, which had so long befriended us, died
away, and was succeeded by one from the north-east. When day appeared
we had lost sight of the land, and did not regain it until the 19th, at
only the distance of 17 leagues from our desired port. The wind was now
fair, the sky serene, though a little hazy, and the temperature of
the air delightfully pleasant: joy sparkled in every countenance, and
congratulations issued from every mouth. Ithaca itself was scarcely
more longed for by Ulysses, than Botany Bay by the adventurers who had
traversed so many thousand miles to take possession of it.

"Heavily in clouds came on the day" which ushered in our arrival. To us
it was "a great, an important day," though I hope the foundation, not
the fall, of an empire will be dated from it.

On the morning of the 20th, by ten o'clock, the whole of the fleet had
cast anchor in Botany Bay, where, to our mutual satisfaction, we found
the Governor, and the first division of transports. On inquiry, we
heard, that the 'Supply' had arrived on the 18th, and the transports
only the preceding day.

Thus, after a passage of exactly thirty-six weeks from Portsmouth,
we happily effected our arduous undertaking, with such a train
of unexampled blessings as hardly ever attended a fleet in a like
predicament. Of two hundred and twelve marines we lost only one; and of
seven hundred and seventy-five convicts, put on board in England, but
twenty-four perished in our route. To what cause are we to attribute
this unhoped for success? I wish I could answer to the liberal manner in
which Government supplied the expedition. But when the reader is told,
that some of the necessary articles allowed to ships on a common passage
to West Indies, were withheld from us; that portable soup, wheat, and
pickled vegetables were not allowed; and that an inadequate quantity of
essence of malt was the only antiscorbutic supplied, his surprise will
redouble at the result of the voyage. For it must be remembered, that
the people thus sent out were not a ship's company starting with every
advantage of health and good living, which a state of freedom produces;
but the major part a miserable set of convicts, emaciated from
confinement, and in want of cloaths, and almost every convenience to
render so long a passage tolerable. I beg leave, however, to say, that
the provisions served on board were good, and of a much superior quality
to those usually supplied by contract: they were furnished by Mr.
Richards, junior, of Walworth, Surrey.




CHAPTER VIII.



From the Fleet's Arrival at Botany Bay to the Evacuation of it; and
taking Possession of Port Jackson. Interviews with the Natives; and an
Account of the Country about Botany Bay.


We had scarcely bid each other welcome on our arrival, when
an expedition up the Bay was undertaken by the Governor and
Lieutenant-Governor, in order to explore the nature of the country, and
fix on a spot to begin our operations upon. None, however, which could
be deemed very eligible, being discovered, his Excellency proceeded in
a boat to examine the opening, to which Mr. Cook had given the name of
Port Jackson, on an idea that a shelter for shipping within it might
be found. The boat returned on the evening of the 23rd, with such an
account of the harbour and advantages attending the place, that it
was determined the evacuation of Botany Bay should commence the next
morning.

In consequence of this decision, the few seamen and marines who had
been landed from the squadron, were instantly reimbarked, and every
preparation made to bid adieu to a port which had so long been the
subject of our conversation; which but three days before we had entered
with so many sentiments of satisfaction; and in which, as we had
believed, so many of our future hours were to be passed. The thoughts of
removal banished sleep, so that I rose at the first dawn of the morning.
But judge of my surprize on hearing from a serjeant, who ran down almost
breathless to the cabin where I was dressing, that a ship was seen off
the harbour's mouth. At first I only laughed, but knowing the man
who spoke to me to be of great veracity, and hearing him repeat his
information, I flew upon deck, on which I had barely set my foot, when
the cry of "another sail" struck on my astonished ear.

Confounded by a thousand ideas which arose in my mind in an instant, I
sprang upon the barricado and plainly descried two ships of considerable
size, standing in for the mouth of the Bay. By this time the alarm had
become general, and every one appeared lost in conjecture. Now they were
Dutchmen sent to dispossess us, and the moment after storeships from
England, with supplies for the settlement. The improbabilities which
attended both these conclusions, were sunk in the agitation of the
moment. It was by Governor Phillip, that this mystery was at length
unravelled, and the cause of the alarm pronounced to be two French
ships, which, it was now recollected, were on a voyage of discovery
in the southern hemisphere. Thus were our doubts cleared up, and our
apprehensions banished; it was, however, judged expedient to postpone
our removal to Port Jackson, until a complete confirmation of our
conjectures could be procured.

Had the sea breeze set in, the strange ships would have been at anchor
in the Bay by eight o'clock in the morning, but the wind blowing out,
they were driven by a strong lee current to the southward of the port.
On the following day they re-appeared in their former situation, and a
boat was sent to them, with a lieutenant of the navy in her, to offer
assistance, and point out the necessary marks for entering the harbour.
In the course of the day the officer returned, and brought intelligence
that the ships were the Boussole and Astrolabe, sent out by order of
the King of France, and under the command of Monsieur De Perrouse. The
astonishment of the French at seeing us, had not equalled that we had
experienced, for it appeared, that in the course of their voyage they
had touched at Kamschatka, and by that means learnt that our expedition
was in contemplation. They dropped anchor the next morning, just as
we had got under weigh to work out of the Bay, so that for the present
nothing more than salutations could pass between us.

Before I quit Botany Bay, I shall relate the observations we were
enabled to make during our short stay there; as well as those which our
subsequent visits to it from Port Jackson enabled us to complete.

The Bay is very open, and greatly exposed to the fury of the S.E. winds,
which, when they blow, cause a heavy and dangerous swell. It is of
prodigious extent, the principal arm, which takes a S.W. direction,
being not less, including its windings, than twenty four miles from the
capes which form the entrance, according to the report of the French
officers, who took uncommon pains to survey it. At the distance of a
league from the harbour's mouth is a bar, on which at low water, not
more than fifteen feet are to be found. Within this bar, for many miles
up the S.W. arm, is a haven, equal in every respect to any hitherto
known, and in which any number of ships might anchor, secured from all
winds. The country around far exceeds in richness of soil that about
Cape Banks and Point Solander, though unfortunately they resemble each
other in one respect, a scarcity of fresh water.

We found the natives tolerably numerous as we advanced up the river, and
even at the harbour's mouth we had reason to conclude the country more
populous than Mr. Cook thought it. For on the Supply's arrival in the
Bay on the 18th of the month, they were assembled on the beach of the
south shore, to the number of not less than forty persons, shouting
and making many uncouth signs and gestures. This appearance whetted
curiosity to its utmost, but as prudence forbade a few people to venture
wantonly among so great a number, and a party of only six men was
observed on the north shore, the Governor immediately proceeded to land
on that side, in order to take possession of his new territory, and
bring about an intercourse between its old and new masters. The boat in
which his Excellency was, rowed up the harbour, close to the land, for
some distance; the Indians keeping pace with her on the beach. At last
an officer in the boat made signs of a want of water, which it was
judged would indicate his wish of landing. The natives directly
comprehended what he wanted, and pointed to a spot where water could
be procured; on which the boat was immediately pushed in, and a landing
took place. As on the event of this meeting might depend so much of
our future tranquillity, every delicacy on our side was requisite.
The Indians, though timorous, shewed no signs of resentment at the
Governor's going on shore; an interview commenced, in which the conduct
of both parties pleased each other so much, that the strangers returned
to their ships with a much better opinion of the natives than they had
landed with; and the latter seemed highly entertained with their new
acquaintance, from whom they condescended to accept of a looking glass,
some beads, and other toys.

Owing to the lateness of our arrival, it was not my good fortune to go
on shore until three days after this had happened, when I went with a
party to the south side of the harbour, and had scarcely landed five
minutes, when we were met by a dozen Indians, naked as at the moment of
their birth, walking along the beach. Eager to come to a conference, and
yet afraid of giving offence, we advanced with caution towards them,
nor would they, at first approach nearer to us than the distance of
some paces. Both parties were armed; yet an attack seemed as unlikely on
their part, as we knew it to be on our own.

I had at this time a little boy, of not more than seven years of age, in
my hand. The child seemed to attract their attention very much, for they
frequently pointed to him and spoke to each other; and as he was not
frightened, I advanced with him towards them, at the same time baring
his bosom and, shewing the whiteness of the skin. On the cloaths being
removed, they gave a loud exclamation, and one of the party, an old man,
with a long beard, hideously ugly, came close to us. I bade my little
charge not to be afraid, and introduced him to the acquaintance of this
uncouth personage. The Indian, with great gentleness, laid his hand on
the child's hat, and afterwards felt his cloaths, muttering to himself
all the while. I found it necessary, however, by this time to send away
the child, as such a close connection rather alarmed him; and in this,
as the conclusion verified, I gave no offence to the old gentleman.
Indeed it was but putting ourselves on a par with them, as I had
observed from the first, that some youths of their own, though
considerably older than the one with us, were, kept back by the grown
people.

Several more now came up, to whom, we made various presents, but our
toys seemed not to be regarded as very valuable; nor would they for a
long time make any returns to them, though before we parted, a large
club, with a head almost sufficient to fell an ox, was obtained in
exchange for a looking-glass. These people seemed at a loss to know
(probably from our want of beards) of what sex we were, which having
understood, they burst into the most immoderate fits of laughter,
talking to each other at the same time with such rapidity and
vociferation as I had never before heard. After nearly an hour's
conversation by signs and gestures, they repeated several times the word
whurra, which signifies, begone, and walked away from us to the head of
the Bay.

The natives being departed, we set out to observe the country, which,
on inspection, rather disappointed our hopes, being invariably sandy and
unpromising for the purposes of cultivation, though the trees and grass
flourish in great luxuriancy. Close to us was the spring at which Mr.
Cook watered, but we did not think the water very excellent, nor did
it run freely. In the evening we returned on board, not greatly pleased
with the latter part of our discoveries, as it indicated an increase of
those difficulties, which before seemed sufficiently numerous.

Between this and our departure we had several more interviews with the
natives, which ended in so friendly a manner, that we began to entertain
strong hopes of bringing about a connection with them. Our first object
was to win their affections, and our next to convince them of the
superiority we possessed: for without the latter, the former we knew
would be of little importance.

An officer one day prevailed on one of them to place a target, made of
bark, against a tree, which he fired at with a pistol, at the distance
of some paces. The Indians, though terrified at the report, did not run
away, but their astonishment exceeded their alarm, on looking at the
shield which the ball had perforated. As this produced a little shyness,
the officer, to dissipate their fears and remove their jealousy,
whistled the air of Malbrooke, which they appeared highly charmed
with, and imitated him with equal pleasure and readiness. I cannot help
remarking here, what I was afterwards told by Monsieur De Perrouse, that
the natives of California, and throughout all the islands of the Pacific
Ocean, and in short wherever he had been, seemed equally touched and
delighted with this little plaintive air.




CHAPTER IX.



The taking Possession of Port Jackson, with the Disembarkation of the
Marines and Convicts.


Our passage to Port Jackson took up but few hours, and those were spent
far from unpleasantly. The evening was bright, and the prospect before
us such as might justify sanguine expectation. Having passed between the
capes which form its entrance, we found ourselves in a port superior, in
extent and excellency, to all we had seen before. We continued to run
up the harbour about four miles, in a westerly direction, enjoying the
luxuriant prospect of its shores, covered with trees to the water's
edge, among which many of the Indians were frequently seen, till we
arrived at a small snug cove on the southern side, on whose banks the
plan of our operations was destined to commence.

The landing of a part of the marines and convicts took place the next
day, and on the following, the remainder was disembarked. Business
now sat on every brow, and the scene, to an indifferent spectator,
at leisure to contemplate it, would have been highly picturesque and
amusing. In one place, a party cutting down the woods; a second, setting
up a blacksmith's forge; a third, dragging along a load of stones or
provisions; here an officer pitching his marquee, with a detachment of
troops parading on one side of him, and a cook's fire blazing up on
the other. Through the unwearied diligence of those at the head of the
different departments, regularity was, however, soon introduced, and, as
far as the unsettled state of matters would allow, confusion gave place
to system.

Into the head of the cove, on which our establishment is fixed, runs a
small stream of fresh water, which serves to divide the adjacent country
to a little distance, in the direction of north and south. On the
eastern side of this rivulet the Governor fixed his place of residence,
with a large body of convicts encamped near him; and on the western
side was disposed the remaining part of these people, near the marine
encampment. From this last two guards, consisting of two subalterns, as
many serjeants, four corporals, two drummers, and forty-two private men,
under the orders of a Captain of the day, to whom all reports were
made, daily mounted for the public security, with such directions to
use force, in case of necessity, as left no room for those who were the
object of the order, but to remain peaceable, or perish by the bayonet.

As the straggling of the convicts was not only a desertion from the
public labour, but might be attended with ill consequences to the
settlement, in case of their meeting the natives, every care was taken
to prevent it. The Provost Martial with his men was ordered to patrole
the country around, and the convicts informed, that the severest
punishment would be inflicted on transgressors. In spite, however, of
all our precautions, they soon found the road to Botany Bay, in visits
to the French, who would gladly have dispensed with their company.

But as severity alone was known to be inadequate at once to chastize and
reform, no opportunity was omitted to assure the convicts, that by
their good behaviour and submissive deportment, every claim to present
distinction and future favour was to be earned. That this caution was
not attended with all the good effects which were hoped from it, I have
only to lament; that it operated in some cases is indisputable; nor will
a candid and humane mind fail to consider and allow for the situation
these unfortunate beings so peculiarly stood in. While they were on
board ship, the two sexes had been kept most rigorously apart; but,
when landed, their separation became impracticable, and would have been,
perhaps, wrong. Licentiousness was the unavoidable consequence, and
their old habits of depravity were beginning to recur. What was to be
attempted? To prevent their intercourse was impossible; and to palliate
its evils only remained. Marriage was recommended, and such advantages
held out to those who aimed at reformation, as have greatly contributed
to the tranquillity of the settlement.

On the Sunday after our landing divine service was performed under a
great tree, by the Rev. Mr. Johnson, Chaplain of the Settlement, in the
presence of the troops and convicts, whose behaviour on the occasion
was equally regular and attentive. In the course of our passage this
had been repeated every Sunday, while the ships were in port; and in
addition to it, Mr. Johnson had furnished them with books, at once
tending to promote instruction and piety.

The Indians for a little while after our arrival paid us frequent
visits, but in a few days they were observed to be more shy of our
company. From what cause their distaste: arose we never could trace,
as we had made it our study, on these occasions, to treat them with
kindness, and load them with presents. No quarrel had happened, and we
had flattered ourselves, from Governor Phillip's first reception among
them, that such a connection might be established as would tend to the
interest of both parties. It seems, that on that occasion, they not only
received our people with great cordiality, but so far acknowledged their
authority as to submit, that a boundary, during their first interview,
might be drawn on the sand, which they attempted not to infringe, and
appeared to be satisfied with.




CHAPTER X.



The reading of the Commissions, and taking Possession of the Settlement,
in form. With an Account of the Courts of Law, and Mode of administering
Public Justice in this Country.


Owing to the multiplicity of pressing business necessary to be performed
immediately after landing, it was found impossible to read the public
commissions and take possession of the colony in form, until the 7th of
February. On that day all the officers of guard took post in the marine
battalion, which was drawn up, and marched off the parade with music
playing, and colours flying, to an adjoining ground, which had been
cleared for the occasion, whereon the convicts were assembled to hear
His Majesty's commission read, appointing his Excellency Arthur Phillip,
Esq. Governor and Captain General in and over the territory of New South
Wales, and its dependencies; together with the Act of Parliament for
establishing trials by law within the same; and the patents under the
Great Seal of Great Britain, for holding the civil and criminal courts
of judicature, by which all cases of life and death, as well as matters
of property, were to be decided. When the Judge Advocate had finished
reading, his Excellency addressed himself to the convicts in a pointed
and judicious speech, informing them of his future intentions, which
were, invariably to cherish and render happy those who shewed a
disposition to amendment; and to let the rigour of the law take its
course against such as might dare to transgress the bounds prescribed.
At the close three vollies were fired in honour of the occasion, and the
battalion marched back to their parade, where they were reviewed by the
Governor, who was received with all the honours due to his rank. His
Excellency was afterwards pleased to thank them, in public orders,
for their behaviour from the time of their embarkation; and to ask the
officers to partake of a cold collation at which it is scarce
necessary to observe, that many loyal and public toasts were drank in
commemoration of the day.

In the Governor's commission, the extent of this authority is defined
to reach from the latitude of 43 deg 49 min south, to the latitude of
10 deg 37 min south, being the northern and southern extremities of
the continent of New Holland. It commences again at 135th degree of
longitude east of Greenwich, and, proceeding in an easterly direction,
includes all islands within the limits of the above specified latitudes
in the Pacific Ocean. By this partition it may be fairly presumed, that
every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us will be
for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators alone are
comprized in this territory.

Nor have Government been more backward in arming Mr. Phillip with
plenitude of power, than extent of dominion. No mention is made of a
Council to be appointed, so that he is left to act entirely from his own
judgment. And as no stated time of assembling the Courts of justice is
pointed out, similar to the assizes and gaol deliveries of England,
the duration of imprisonment is altogether in his hands. The power of
summoning General Courts Martial to meet he is also invested with, but
the insertion in the marine mutiny act, of a smaller number of officers
than thirteen being able to compose such a tribunal, has been neglected:
so that a Military court, should detachments be made from headquarters,
or sickness prevail, may not always be found practicable to be obtained,
unless the number of officers, at present in the Settlement, shall be
increased.

Should the Governor see cause, he is enabled to grant pardons to
offenders convicted, "in all cases whatever, treason and wilful murder
excepted," and even in these, has authority to stay the execution of
the law, until the King's pleasure shall be signified. In case of the
Governor's death, the Lieutenant Governor takes his place; and on his
demise, the senior officer on the spot is authorised to assume the reins
of power.

Notwithstanding the promises made on one side, and the forbearance
shewn on the other, joined to the impending rod of justice, it was
with infinite regret that every one saw, in four clays afterwards, the
necessity of assembling a Criminal Court, which was accordingly convened
by warrant from the Governor, and consisted of the judge Advocate, who
presided, three naval, and three marine officers.

As the constitution of this court is altogether new in the British
annals, I hope my reader will not think me prolix in the description
I am about to give of it. The number of members, including the judge
Advocate, is limited, by Act of Parliament, to seven, who are expressly
ordered to be officers, either of His Majesty's sea or land forces. The
court being met, completely arrayed and armed as at a military tribunal,
the Judge Advocate proceeds to administer the usual oaths taken by
jurymen in England to each member; one of whom afterwards swears him
in a like manner. This ceremony being adjusted, the crime laid to the
prisoner's charge is read to him, and the question of Guilty, or Not
guilty, put. No law officer on the side of the crown being appointed,
(for I presume the head of the court ought hardly to consider himself
in that light, notwithstanding the title he bears) to prosecute the
criminal is left entirely to the party, at whose suit he is tried. All
the witnesses are examined on oath, and the decision is directed to
be given according to the laws of England, "or as nearly as may be,
allowing for the circumstances and situation of the settlement," by a
majority of votes, beginning with the youngest member, and ending with
the president of the court. In cases, however, of a capital nature,
no verdict can be given, unless five, at least, of the seven members
present concur therein. The evidence on both sides being finished,
and the prisoner's defence heard, the court is cleared, and, on the
judgement being settled, is thrown open again, and sentence pronounced.
During the time the court sits, the place in which it is assembled is
directed to be surrounded by a guard under arms, and admission to every
one who may choose to enter it, granted. Of late, however, our colonists
are supposed to be in such a train of subordination, as to make the
presence of so large a military force unnecessary; and two centinels, in
addition to the Provost Martial, are considered as sufficient.

It would be as needless, as impertinent, to anticipate the reflections
which will arise in reading the above account, wherein a regard to
accuracy only has been consulted. By comparing it with the mode of
administering justice in the English courts of law, it will be found to
differ in many points very essentially. And if we turn our eyes to
the usage of military tribunals, it no less departs from the customs
observed in them. Let not the novelty of it, however, prejudice any one
so far as to dispute its efficacy, and the necessity of the case which
gave it birth.

The court, whose meeting is already spoken of, proceeded to the trial of
three convicts, one of whom was convicted of having struck a marine with
a cooper's adze, and otherwise behaving in a very riotous and scandalous
manner, for which he was sentenced to receive one hundred and fifty
lashes, being a smaller punishment than a soldier in a like case would
have suffered from the judgement of a court martial. A second, for
having committed a petty theft, was sent to a small barren island,
and kept there on bread and water only, for a week. And the third was
sentenced to receive fifty lashes, but was recommended by the court to
the Governor, and forgiven.

Hitherto, however, (February) nothing of a very atrocious nature had
appeared. But the day was at hand, on which the violation of public
security could no longer be restrained, by the infliction of temporary
punishment. A set of desperate and hardened villains leagued themselves
for the purposes of depredation, and, as it generally happens, had art
enough to persuade some others, less deeply versed in iniquity, to be
the instruments for carrying it on. Fortunately the progress of these
miscreants was not of long duration. They were detected in stealing a
large quantity of provisions at the time of issuing them. And on being
apprehended, one of the tools of the superiors impeached the rest, and
disclosed the scheme. The trial came on the 28th of the month, and of
four who were arraigned for the offence, three were condemned to die,
and the fourth to receive a very severe corporal punishment. In hopes
that his lenity would not be abused, his Excellency was, however,
pleased to order one only for execution, which took place a little
before sun-set the same day. The name of the unhappy wretch was Thomas
Barret, an old and desperate offender, who died with that hardy spirit,
which too often is found in the worst and most abandoned class of men.
During the execution the battalion of marines was under arms, and the
whole of the convicts obliged to be present. The two associates of the
sufferer were ordered to be kept close prisoners, until an eligible
place to banish them to could be fixed on; as were also two more, who on
the following day were condemned to die for a similar offence.

Besides the Criminal court, there is an inferior one composed of the
Judge Advocate, and one or more justices of the peace, for the trial of
small misdemeanours. This court is likewise empowered to decide all law
suits, and its verdict is final, except where the sum in dispute amounts
to more than three hundred pounds, in which case an appeal to England
can be made from its decree. Should necessity warrant it, an Admiralty
court, of which Lieutenant Governor Ross is judge, can also be summoned,
for the trial of offences committed on the high seas.

From being unwilling to break the thread of my narrative, I omitted to
note in its proper place the sailing of the 'Supply', Lieut. Ball,
on the 15th of the month, for Norfolk Island, which the Governor had
instructions from the ministry to take possession of. Lieut. King of
the Sirius was sent as superintendent and commandant of this place,
and carried with him a surgeon, a midshipman, a sawyer, a weaver, two
marines, and sixteen convicts, of whom six were women. He was also
supplied with a certain number of live animals to stock the island,
besides garden seeds, grain, and other requisites.




CHAPTER XI


A Description of the Natives of New South Wales, and our Transactions
with them.


I doubt not my readers will be as glad as I feel myself, to conclude the
dull detail of the last chapter. If they please, they may turn from the
subtle intricacies of the law, to contemplate the simple, undisguised
workings of nature, in her most artless colouring.

I have already said, we had been but very few days at Port Jackson, when
an alteration in the behaviour of the natives was perceptible; and I
wish I could add, that a longer residence in their neighbourhood had
introduced a greater degree of cordiality and intermixture between
the old, and new, lords of the soil, than at the day on which this
publication is dated subsists.

From their easy reception of us in the beginning, many were induced to
call in question the accounts which Mr. Cook had given of this people.
That celebrated navigator, we were willing believe, had somehow by
his conduct offended them, which prevented the intercourse that would
otherwise have taken place. The result, however, of our repeated
endeavours to induce them to come among us has been such as to confirm
me in an opinion, that they either fear or despise us too much, to be
anxious for a closer connection. And I beg leave at once, to apprize the
reader, that all I can here, or in any future part of this work, relate
with fidelity of the natives of New South Wales, must be made up of
detached observations, taken at different times, and not from a regular
series of knowledge of the customs and manners of a people, with whom
opportunities of communication are so scarce, as to have been seldom
obtained.

In their persons, they are far from being a stout race of men, though
nimble, sprightly, and vigorous. The deficiency of one of the fore teeth
of the upper jaw, mentioned by Dampier, we have seen in almost the whole
of the men; but their organs of sight so far from being defective, as
that author mentions those of the inhabitants of the western side of the
continent to be, are remarkably quick and piercing. Their colour, Mr.
Cook is inclined to think rather a deep chocolate, than an absolute
black, though he confesses, they have the appearance of the latter,
which he attributes to the greasy filth their skins are loaded with.
Of their want of cleanliness we have had sufficient proofs, but I am of
opinion, all the washing in the world would not render them two degrees
less black than an African negro. At some of our first interviews, we
had several droll instances of their mistaking the Africans we brought
with us for their own countrymen.

Notwithstanding the disregard they have invariably shewn for all the
finery we could deck them with, they are fond of adorning themselves
with scars, which increase their natural hideousness. It is hardly
possible to see any thing in human shape more ugly, than one of these
savages thus scarified, and farther ornamented with a fish bone struck
through the gristle of the nose. The custom of daubing themselves
with white earth is also frequent among both sexes: but, unlike the
inhabitants of the Islands in the Pacific Ocean, they reject the
beautiful feathers which the birds of their country afford.

Exclusive of their weapons of offence, and a few stone hatchets very
rudely fashioned, their ingenuity is confined to manufacturing small
nets, in which they put the fish they catch, and to fish-hooks made of
bone, neither of which are unskilfully executed. On many of the rocks
are also to be found delineations of the figures of men and birds, very
poorly cut.

Of the use or benefit of cloathing, these people appear to have no
comprehension, though their sufferings from the climate they live in,
strongly point out the necessity of a covering from the rigour of the
seasons. Both sexes, and those of all ages, are invariably found naked.
But it must not be inferred from this, that custom so inures them to
the changes of the elements, as to make them bear with indifference the
extremes of heat and cold; for we have had visible and repeated proofs,
that the latter affects them severely, when they are seen shivering,
and huddling themselves up in heaps in their huts, or the caverns of the
rocks, until a fire can be kindled.

Than these huts nothing more rude in construction, or deficient in
conveniency, can be imagined. They consist only of pieces of bark laid
together in the form of an oven, open at one end, and very low, though
long enough for a man to lie at full length. There is reason, however,
to believe, that they depend less on them for shelter, than on the
caverns with which the rocks abound.

To cultivation of the ground they are utter strangers, and wholly depend
for food on the few fruits they gather; the roots they dig up in the
swamps; and the fish they pick up along shore, or contrive to strike
from their canoes with spears. Fishing, indeed, seems to engross nearly
the whole of their time, probably from its forming the chief part of a
subsistence, which, observation has convinced us, nothing short of the
most painful labour, and unwearied assiduity, can procure. When fish
are scarce, which frequently happens, they often watch the moment of
our hauling the seine, and have more than once been known to plunder its
contents, in spite of the opposition of those on the spot to guard it:
and this even after having received a part of what had been caught. The
only resource at these times is to shew a musquet, and if the bare sight
is not sufficient, to fire it over their heads, which has seldom failed
of dispersing them hitherto, but how long the terror which it excites
may continue is doubtful.

The canoes in which they fish are as despicable as their huts, being
nothing more than a large piece of bark tied up at both ends with vines.
Their dexterous management of them, added to the swiftness with which
they paddle, and the boldness that leads them several miles in the
open sea, are, nevertheless, highly deserving of admiration. A canoe
is seldom seen without a fire in it, to dress the fish by, as soon as
caught: fire they procure by attrition.

From their manner of disposing of those who die, which will be mentioned
hereafter, as well as from every other observation, there seems no
reason to suppose these people cannibals; nor do they ever eat animal
substances in a raw state, unless pressed by extreme hunger, but
indiscriminately broil them, and their vegetables, on a fire, which
renders these last an innocent food, though in their raw state many of
them are of a poisonous quality: as a poor convict who unguardedly
eat of them experienced, by falling a sacrifice in twenty-four hours
afterwards. If bread be given to the Indians, they chew and spit it
out again, seldom choosing to swallow it. Salt beef and pork they like
rather better, but spirits they never could be brought to taste a second
time.

The only domestic animal they have is the dog, which in their language
is called Dingo, and a good deal resembles the fox dog of England. These
animals are equally shy of us, and attached to the natives. One of them
is now in the possession of the Governor, and tolerably well reconciled
to his new master. As the Indians see the dislike of the dogs to us,
they are sometimes mischievous enough to set them on single persons
whom they chance to meet in the woods. A surly fellow was one day out
shooting, when the natives attempted to divert themselves in this manner
at his expense. The man bore the teazing and gnawing of the dog at his
heels for some time, but apprehending at length, that his patience might
embolden them to use still farther liberties, he turned round and shot
poor Dingo dead on the spot: the owners of him set off with the utmost
expedition.

There is no part of the behaviour of these people, that has puzzled us
more, than that which relates to their women. Comparatively speaking we
have seen but few of them, and those have been sometimes kept back with
every symptom of jealous sensibility; and sometimes offered with every
appearance of courteous familiarity. Cautious, however, of alarming the
feelings of the men on so tender a point, we have constantly made a rule
of treating the females with that distance and reserve, which we judged
most likely to remove any impression they might have received of our
intending aught, which could give offence on so delicate a subject. And
so successful have our endeavours been, that a quarrel on this head
has in no instance, that I know of, happened. The tone of voice of the
women, which is pleasingly soft and feminine, forms a striking contrast
to the rough guttural pronunciation of the men. Of the other charms
of the ladies I shall be silent, though justice obliges me to mention,
that, in the opinion of some amongst us, they shew a degree of timidity
and bashfulness, which are, perhaps, inseparable from the female
character in its rudest state. It is not a little singular, that the
custom of cutting off the two lower joints of the little finger of the
left hand, observed in the Society Islands, is found here among the
women, who have for the most part undergone this amputation. Hitherto
we have not been able to trace out the cause of this usage. At first we
supposed it to be peculiar to the married women, or those who had borne
children; but this conclusion must have been erroneous, as we have no
right to believe that celibacy prevails in any instance, and some of the
oldest of the women are without this distinction; and girls of a very
tender age are marked by it.

On first setting foot in the country, we were inclined to hold the
spears of the natives very cheap. Fatal experience has, however,
convinced us, that the wound inflicted by this weapon is not a trivial
one; and that the skill of the Indians in throwing it, is far from
despicable. Besides more than a dozen convicts who have unaccountably
disappeared, we know that two, who were employed as rush cutters up
the harbour, were (from what cause we are yet ignorant) most dreadfully
mangled and butchered by the natives. A spear had passed entirely
through the thickest part of the body of one of them, though a very
robust man, and the skull of the other was beaten in. Their tools were
taken away, but some provisions which they had with them at the time of
the murder, and their cloaths, were left untouched. In addition to this
misfortune, two more convicts, who were peaceably engaged in picking of
greens, on a spot very remote from that where their comrades suffered,
were unawares attacked by a party of Indians, and before they could
effect their escape, one of them was pierced by a spear in the hip,
after which they knocked him down, and plundered his cloaths. The poor
wretch, though dreadfully wounded, made shift to crawl off, but his
companion was carried away by these barbarians, and his fate doubtful,
until a soldier, a few days afterwards, picked up his jacket and hat
in a native's hut, the latter pierced through by a spear. We have found
that these spears are not made invariably alike, some of them being
barbed like a fish gig, and others simply pointed. In repairing them
they are no less dexterous than in throwing them. A broken one
being given by a gentleman to an Indian, he instantly snatched up an
oyster-shell, and converted it with his teeth into a tool with which
he presently fashioned the spear, and rendered it fit for use: in
performing this operation, the sole of his foot served him as a
work-board. Nor are their weapons of offence confined to the spear only,
for they have besides long wooden swords, shaped like a sabre, capable
of inflicting a mortal wound, and clubs of an immense size. Small
targets, made of the bark of trees, are likewise now and then to be seen
among them.

From circumstances which have been observed, we have sometimes been
inclined to believe these people at war with each other. They have more
than once been seen assembled, as if bent on an expedition. An officer
one day met fourteen of them marching along in a regular Indian file
through the woods, each man armed with a spear in his right hand, and
a large stone in his left: at their head appeared a chief, who was
distinguished by being painted. Though in the proportion of five to one
of our people they passed peaceably on.

That their skill in throwing the spear sometimes enables them to kill
the kangaroo we have no right to doubt, as a long splinter of this
weapon was taken out of the thigh of one of these animals, over which
the flesh had completely closed; but we have never discovered that they
have any method of ensnaring them, or that they know any other beasts
but the kangaroo and dog. Whatever animal is shewn them, a dog excepted,
they call kangaroo: a strong presumption that the wild animals of the
country are very few.

Soon after our arrival at Port Jackson, I was walking out near a place
where I observed a party of Indians, busily employed in looking at some
sheep in an inclosure, and repeatedly crying out, 'kangaroo, kangaroo!'
As this seemed to afford them pleasure, I was willing to increase it by
pointing out the horses and cows, which were at no great distance. But
unluckily, at the moment, some female convicts, employed near the place,
made their appearance, and all my endeavours to divert their attention
from the ladies became fruitless. They attempted not, however, to offer
them the least degree of violence or injury, but stood at the distance
of several paces, expressing very significantly the manner they were
attracted.

It would be trespassing on the reader's indulgence were I to impose
on him an account of any civil regulations, or ordinances, which may
possibly exist among this people. I declare to him, that I know not of
any, and that excepting a little tributary respect which the younger
part appear to pay those more advanced in years, I never could observe
any degrees of subordination among them. To their religious rites and
opinions I am equally a stranger. Had an opportunity offered of seeing
the ceremonies observed at disposing of the dead, perhaps, some insight
might have been gained; but all that we at present know with certainty
is, that they burn the corpse, and afterwards heap up the earth around
it, somewhat in the manner of the small tumuli, found in many counties
of England.

I have already hinted, that the country is more populous than it was
generally believed to be in Europe at the time of our sailing. But
this remark is not meant to be extended to the interior parts of the
continent, which there is every reason to conclude from our researches,
as well as from the manner of living practised by the natives, to be
uninhabited. It appears as if some of the Indian families confine their
society and connections within their own pale: but that this cannot
always be the case we know; for on the north-west arm of Botany Bay
stands a village, which contains more than a dozen houses, and
perhaps five times that number of people; being the most considerable
establishment that we are acquainted with in the country. As a striking
proof, besides, of the numerousness of the natives, I beg leave to
state, that Governor Phillip, when on an excursion between the head of
this harbour and that of Botany Bay, once fell in with a party which
consisted of more than three hundred persons, two hundred and twelve of
whom were men: this happened only on the day following the murder of the
two convict rush cutters, before noticed, and his Excellency was at
the very time in search of the murderers, on whom, could they have been
found, he intended to inflict a memorable and exemplary punishment. The
meeting was unexpected to both parties, and considering the critical
situation of affairs, perhaps not very pleasing to our side, which
consisted but of twelve persons, until the peaceable disposition of
the Indians was manifest. After the strictest search the Governor was
obliged to return without having gained any information. The laudable
perseverance of his Excellency to throw every light on this unhappy and
mysterious business did not, however stop here, for he instituted the
most rigorous inquiry to find out, if possible, whether the convicts
had at any time ill treated or killed any of the natives; and farther,
issued a proclamation, offering the most tempting of all rewards, a
state of freedom, to him who should point out the murderer, in case such
an one existed.

I have thus impartially stated the situation of matters, as they stand,
while I write, between the natives and us; that greater progress in
attaching them to us has not been made, I have only to regret; but that
all ranks of men have tried to effect it, by every reasonable effort
from which success might have been expected, I can testify; nor can
I omit saying, that in the higher stations this has been eminently
conspicuous. The public orders of Governor Phillip have invariably
tended to promote such a behaviour on our side, as was most likely
to produce this much wished-for event. To what cause then are we to
attribute the distance which the accomplishment of it appears at? I
answer, to the fickle, jealous, wavering disposition of the people we
have to deal with, who, like all other savages, are either too indolent,
too indifferent, or too fearful to form an attachment on easy terms,
with those who differ in habits and manners so widely from themselves.
Before I close the subject, I cannot, however, omit to relate the
following ludicrous adventure, which possibly may be of greater use in
effecting what we have so much at heart, than all our endeavours.

Some young gentlemen belonging to the Sirius one day met a native, an
old man, in the woods; he had a beard of considerable length, which his
new acquaintance gave him to understand, by signals, they would rid him
of, if he pleased; stroaking their chins, and shewing him the smoothness
of them at the same time; at length the old Indian consented, and one of
the youngsters taking a penknife from his pocket, and making use of the
best substitute for lather he could find, performed the operation with
great success, and, as it proved, much to the liking of the old man, who
in a few days after reposed a confidence in us, of which we had hitherto
known no example, by paddling along-side the Sirius in his canoe, and
pointing to his beard. Various arts were ineffectually tried to induce
him to enter the ship; but as he continued to decline the invitation,
a barber was sent down into the boat along-side the canoe, from whence,
leaning over the gunnel, he complied with the wish of the old beau, to
his infinite satisfaction. In addition to the consequences which our
sanguine hopes led us to expect from this dawning of cordiality, it
affords proof, that the beard is considered by this people more as an
incumbrance than a mark of dignity.




CHAPTER XII.


The Departure of the French from Botany Bay; and the Return of the
'Supply' from Norfolk Island; with a Discovery made by Lieutenant Ball
on his Passage to it.


About the middle of the month our good friends the French departed from
Botany Bay, in prosecution of their voyage. During their stay in that
port, the officers of the two nations had frequent opportunities of
testifying their mutual regard by visits, and every interchange of
friendship and esteem. These ships sailed from France, by order of
the King, on the 1st of August, 1785, under the command of Monsieur
De Perrouse, an officer whose eminent qualifications, we had reason
to think, entitle him to fill the highest stations. In England,
particularly, he ought long to be remembered with admiration and
gratitude, for the humanity which marked his conduct, when ordered to
destroy our settlement at Hudson's Bay, in the last war. His second
in command was the Chevalier Clonard, an officer also of distinguished
merit.

In the course of the voyage these ships had been so unfortunate as
to lose a boat, with many men and officers in her, off the west of
California; and afterwards met with an accident still more to be
regretted, at an island in the Pacific Ocean, discovered by Monsieur
Bougainville, in the latitude of 14 deg 19 min south, longitude 173 deg
3 min 20 sec east of Paris. Here they had the misfortune to have no less
than thirteen of their crews, among whom was the officer at that time
second in command, cut off by the natives, and many more desperately
wounded. To what cause this cruel event was to be attributed, they knew
not, as they were about to quit the island after having lived with the
Indians in the greatest harmony for several weeks; and exchanged, during
the time, their European commodities for the produce of the place, which
they describe as filled with a race of people remarkable for beauty and
comeliness; and abounding in refreshments of all kinds.

It was no less gratifying to an English ear, than honourable to Monsieur
De Perrouse, to witness the feeling manner in which he always mentioned
the name and talents of Captain Cook. That illustrious circumnavigator
had, he said, left nothing to those who might follow in his track to
describe, or fill up. As I found, in the course of conversation, that
the French ships had touched at the Sandwich Islands, I asked M. De
Perrouse what reception he had met with there. His answer deserves to be
known: "During the whole of our voyage in the South Seas, the people of
the Sandwich Islands were the only Indians who never gave us cause of
complaint. They furnished us liberally with provisions, and administered
cheerfully to all our wants." It may not be improper to remark, that
Owhyee was not one of the islands visited by this gentleman.

In the short stay made by these ships at Botany Bay, an Abbe, one of
the naturalists on board, died, and was buried on the north shore. The
French had hardly departed, when the natives pulled down a small board,
which had been placed over the spot where the corpse was interred, and
defaced everything around. On being informed of it, the Governor sent
a party over with orders to affix a plate of copper on a tree near the
place, with the following inscription on it, which is a copy of what was
written on the board:

     Hic jacet L. RECEVEUR,
     E.F.F. minnibus Galliae, Sacerdos, Physicus, in
     circumnavigatione mundi, Duce De La Perrouse.
     Obiit die 17 Februarii, anno 1788.

This mark of respectful attention was more particularly due, from M. De
Perrouse having, when at Kamschatka, paid a similar tribute of gratitude
to the memory of Captain Clarke, whose tomb was found in nearly as
ruinous a state as that of the Abbe.

Like ourselves, the French found it necessary, more than once, to
chastise a spirit of rapine and intrusion which prevailed among the
Indians around the Bay. The menace of pointing a musquet to them was
frequently used; and in one or two instances it was fired off, though
without being attended with fatal consequences. Indeed the French
commandant, both from a regard to the orders of his Court as well as to
our quiet and security, shewed a moderation and forbearance on this head
highly becoming.

On the 20th of March, the 'Supply' arrived from Norfolk Island, after
having safely landed Lieutenant King and his little garrison. The
pine-trees growing there are described to be of a growth and height
superior, perhaps, to any in the world. But the difficulty of bringing
them away will not be easily surmounted, from the badness and danger of
the landing place. After the most exact search not a single plant of the
New Zealand flax could be found, though we had been taught to believe it
abounded there.

Lieutenant Ball, in returning to Port Jackson, touched at a small
island in latitude 31 deg 36 min south, longitude 159 deg 4 min east of
Greenwich, which he had been fortunate enough to discover on his passage
to Norfolk, and to which he gave the name of Lord Howe's Island. It
is entirely without inhabitants, or any traces of any having ever been
there. But it happily abounds in what will be infinitely more important
to the settlers on New South Wales: green turtle of the finest kind
frequent it in the summer season. Of this Mr. Ball gave us some very
handsome and acceptable specimens on his return. Besides turtle, the
island is well stocked with birds, many of them so tame as to be knocked
down by the seamen with sticks. At the distance of four leagues from
Lord Howe Island, and in latitude 31 deg 30 min south, longitude 159 deg
8 min east, stands a remarkable rock, of considerable height, to which
Mr. Ball gave the name of Ball's Pyramid, from the shape it bears.

While the 'Supply' was absent, Governor Phillip made an excursion to
Broken Bay, a few leagues to the northward of Port Jackson, in order to
explore it. As a harbour it almost equals the latter, but the adjacent
country was found so rocky and bare, as to preclude all possibility of
turning it to account. Some rivulets of fresh water fall into the head
of the Bay, forming a very picturesque scene. The Indians who live
on its banks are numerous, and behaved attentively in a variety of
instances while our people remained among them.




CHAPTER XIII.



Transactions at Port Jackson in the Months of April and May.


As winter was fast approaching, it became necessary to secure ourselves
in quarters, which might shield us from the cold we were taught to
expect in this hemisphere, though in so low a latitude. The erection
of barracks for the soldiers was projected, and the private men of
each company undertook to build for themselves two wooden houses, of
sixty-eight feet in length, and twenty-three in breadth. To forward the
design, several saw-pits were immediately set to work, and four ship
carpenters attached to the battalion, for the purpose of directing and
completing this necessary undertaking. In prosecuting it, however,
so many difficulties occurred, that we were fain to circumscribe our
original intention; and, instead of eight houses, content ourselves with
four. And even these, from the badness of the timber, the scarcity of
artificers, and other impediments, are, at the day on which I write, so
little advanced, that it will be well, if at the close of the year 1788,
we shall be established in them. In the meanwhile the married people,
by proceeding on a more contracted scale, were soon under comfortable
shelter. Nor were the convicts forgotten; and as leisure was frequently
afforded them for the purpose, little edifices quickly multiplied on the
ground allotted them to build upon.

But as these habitations were intended by Governor Phillip to answer
only the exigency of the moment, the plan of the town was drawn, and the
ground on which it is hereafter to stand surveyed, and marked out.
To proceed on a narrow, confined scale, in a country of the extensive
limits we possess, would be unpardonable: extent of empire demands
grandeur of design. That this has been our view will be readily
believed, when I tell the reader, that the principal street in our
projected city will be, when completed, agreeable to the plan laid
down, two hundred feet in breadth, and all the rest of a corresponding
proportion. How far this will be accompanied with adequate dispatch, is
another question, as the incredulous among us are sometimes hardy enough
to declare, that ten times our strength would not be able to finish it
in as many years.

Invariably intent on exploring a country, from which curiosity promises
so many gratifications, his Excellency about this time undertook an
expedition into the interior parts of the continent. His party consisted
of eleven persons, who, after being conveyed by water to the head of
the harbour, proceeded in a westerly direction, to reach a chain of
mountains, which in clear weather are discernible, though at an immense
distance, from some heights near our encampment. With unwearied industry
they continued to penetrate the country for four days; but at the end of
that time, finding the base of the mountain to be yet at the distance
of more than twenty miles, and provisions growing scarce, it was judged
prudent to return, without having accomplished the end for which the
expedition had been undertaken. To reward their toils, our adventurers
had, however, the pleasure of discovering and traversing an extensive
tract of ground, which they had reason to believe, from the observations
they were enabled to make, capable of producing every thing, which
a happy soil and genial climate can bring forth. In addition to this
flattering appearance, the face of the country is such, as to
promise success whenever it shall be cultivated, the trees being at
a considerable distance from each other, and the intermediate space
filled, not with underwood, but a thick rich grass, growing in the
utmost luxuriancy. I must not, however, conceal, that in this long
march, our gentlemen found not a single rivulet, but were under a
necessity of supplying themselves with water from standing pools, which
they met with in the vallies, supposed to be formed by the rains that
fall at particular seasons of the year. Nor had they the good fortune to
see any quadrupeds worth notice, except a few kangaroos. To their great
surprize, they observed indisputable tracks of the natives having been
lately there, though in their whole route none of them were to be seen;
nor any means to be traced, by which they could procure subsistence so
far from the sea shore.

On the 6th of May the 'Supply' sailed for Lord Howe Island, to take on
board turtle for the settlement; but after waiting there several days
was obliged to return without having seen one, owing we apprehended to
the advanced season of the year. Three of the transports also, which
were engaged by the East India Company to proceed to China, to take on
board a lading of tea, sailed about this time for Canton.

The unsuccessful return of the 'Supply' cast a general damp on our
spirits, for by this time fresh provisions were become scarcer than in
a blockaded town. The little live stock, which with so heavy an expense,
and through so many difficulties, we had brought on shore, prudence
forbade us to use; and fish, which on our arrival, and for a short time
after had been tolerable plenty, were become so scarce, as to be rarely
seen at the tables of the first among us. Had it not been for a stray
kangaroo, which fortune now and then threw in our way, we should have
been utter strangers to the taste of fresh food.

Thus situated, the scurvy began its usual ravages, and extended its
baneful influence, more or less, through all descriptions of persons.
Unfortunately the esculent vegetable productions of the country are
neither plentiful, nor tend very effectually to remove this disease.
And, the ground we had turned up and planted with garden seeds, either
from the nature of the soil, or, which is more probable, the lateness
of the season, yielded but a scanty and insufficient supply of what we
stood so greatly in need of.

During the period I am describing, few enormous offences were
perpetrated by the convicts. A petty theft was now and then heard
of, and a spirit of refractory sullenness broke out at times in some
individuals: one execution only, however, took place. The sufferer, who
was a very young man, was convicted of a burglary, and met his fate with
a hardiness and insensibility, which the grossest ignorance, and most
deplorable want of feeling, alone could supply.




CHAPTER XIV.



From the Beginning of June, to the Departure of the Ships for Europe.


Hours of festivity, which under happier skies pass away unregarded,
and are soon consigned to oblivion, acquire in this forlorn and distant
circle a superior degree of acceptable importance.

On the anniversary of the King's birthday all the officers not on duty,
both of the garrison and his Majesty's ships, dined with the Governor.
On so joyful an occasion, the first too ever celebrated in our new
settlement, it were needless to say, that loyal conviviality dictated
every sentiment, and inspired every guest. Among other public toasts
drank, was, Prosperity to Sydney Cove, in Cumberland county, now named
so by authority. At day-light in the morning the ships of war had fired
twenty-one guns each, which was repeated at noon, and answered by three
vollies from the battalion of marines.

Nor were the officers alone partakers of the general relaxation. The
four unhappy wretches labouring under sentence of banishment were freed
from their fetters, to rejoin their former society; and three days given
as holidays to every convict in the colony. Hospitality too, which ever
acquires a double relish by being extended, was not forgotten on the 4th
of June, when each prisoner, male and female, received an allowance of
grog; and every non-commissioned officer and private soldier had the
honor of drinking prosperity to his royal master, in a pint of porter,
served out at the flag staff, in addition to the customary allowance
of spirits. Bonfires concluded the evening, and I am happy to say, that
excepting a single instance which shall be taken notice of hereafter, no
bad consequence, or unpleasant remembrance, flowed from an indulgence so
amply bestowed.

About this time (June) an accident happened, which I record with much
regret. The whole of our black cattle, consisting of five cows and a
bull, either from not being properly secured, or from the negligence
of those appointed to take care of them, strayed into the woods, and in
spite of all the search we have been able to make, are not yet found.
As a convict of the name of Corbet, who was accused of a theft, eloped
nearly at the same time, it was at first believed, that he had taken the
desperate measure of driving off the cattle, in order to subsist on them
as long as possible; or perhaps to deliver them to the natives. In this
uncertainty, parties to search were sent out in different directions;
and the fugitive declared an outlaw, in case of not returning by a fixed
day. After much anxiety and fatigue, those who had undertaken the task
returned without finding the cattle. But on the 21st of the month,
Corbet made his appearance near a farm belonging to the Governor, and
entreated a convict, who happened to be on the spot, to give him some
food, as he was perishing for hunger. The man applied to, under pretence
of fetching what he asked for, went away and immediately gave the
necessary information, in consequence of which a party under arms was
sent out and apprehended him. When the poor wretch was brought in, he
was greatly emaciated and almost famished. But on proper restoratives
being administered, he was so far recovered by the 24th, as to be able
to stand his trial, when he pleaded Guilty to the robbery with which he
stood charged, and received sentence of death. In the course of repeated
examinations it plainly appeared, he was an utter stranger to the place
where the cattle might be, and was in no shape concerned in having
driven them off.

Samuel Peyton, convict, for having on the evening of the King's
birth-day broke open an officer's marquee, with an intent to commit
robbery, of which he was fully convicted, had sentence of death passed
on him at the same time as Corbet; and on the following day they were
both executed, confessing the justness of their fate, and imploring the
forgiveness of those whom they had injured. Peyton, at the time of his
suffering, was but twenty years of age, the greatest part of which
had been invariably passed in the commission of crimes, that at length
terminated in his ignominious end. The following letter, written by a
fellow convict to the sufferer's unhappy mother, I shall make no apology
for presenting to the reader; it affords a melancholy proof, that
not the ignorant and untaught only have provoked the justice of their
country to banish them to this remote region.


Sydney Cove, Port Jackson,

New South Wales, 24th June, 1788.

"My dear and honoured mother!

"With a heart oppressed by the keenest sense of anguish, and too much
agitated by the idea of my very melancholy condition, to express my own
sentiments, I have prevailed on the goodness of a commiserating friend,
to do me the last sad office of acquainting you with the dreadful fate
that awaits me.

"My dear mother! with what agony of soul do I dedicate the few
last moments of my life, to bid you an eternal adieu! my doom being
irrevocably fixed, and ere this hour to-morrow I shall have quitted this
vale of wretchedness, to enter into an unknown and endless eternity. I
will not distress your tender maternal feelings by any long comment on
the cause of my present misfortune. Let it therefore suffice to say,
that impelled by that strong propensity to evil, which neither the
virtuous precepts nor example of the best of parents could eradicate, I
have at length fallen an unhappy, though just, victim to my own follies.

"Too late I regret my inattention to your admonitions, and feel myself
sensibly affected by the remembrance of the many anxious moments you
have passed on my account. For these, and all my other transgressions,
however great, I supplicate the Divine forgiveness; and encouraged by
the promises of that Saviour who died for us all, I trust to receive
that mercy in the world to come, which my offences have deprived me of
all hope, or expectation of, in this. The affliction which this will
cost you, I hope the Almighty will enable you to bear. Banish from your
memory all my former indiscretions, and let the cheering hope of a happy
meeting hereafter, console you for my loss. Sincerely penitent for my
sins; sensible of the justice of my conviction and sentence, and firmly
relying on the merits of a Blessed Redeemer, I am at perfect peace with
all mankind, and trust I shall yet experience that peace, which this
world cannot give. Commend my soul to the Divine mercy. I bid you an
eternal farewell.

"Your unhappy dying Son,

"SAMUEL PEYTON."


After this nothing occurred with which I think it necessary to trouble
the reader. The contents of the following chapters could not, I
conceive, be so properly interwoven in the body of the work; I have,
therefore, assigned them a place by themselves, with a view that the
conclusions adopted in them may be more strongly enforced on the minds
of those, to whom they are more particularly addressed.




CHAPTER XV.



The Face of the Country; its Productions, Climate, &c.


To the geographical knowledge of this country, supplied by Captain Cook,
and Captain Furneaux, we are able to add nothing. The latter explored
the coast from Van Diemen's land to the latitude of 39 deg south;
and Cook from Point Hicks, which lies in 37 deg 58 min, to Endeavour
Streights. The intermediate space between the end of Furneaux's
discovery and Point Hicks, is, therefore, the only part of the
south-east coast unknown, and it so happened on our passage thither,
owing to the weather, which forbade any part of the ships engaging with
the shore, that we are unable to pronounce whether, or not, a streight
intersects the continent hereabouts: though I beg leave to say, that I
have been informed by a naval friend, that when the fleet was off this
part of the coast, a strong set-off shore was plainly felt.

At the distance of 60 miles inland, a prodigious chain of lofty
mountains runs nearly in a north and south direction, further than the
eye can trace them. Should nothing intervene to prevent it, the Governor
intends, shortly, to explore their summits: and, I think there can be
little doubt, that his curiosity will not go unrewarded. If large rivers
do exist in the country, which some of us are almost sceptical enough
to doubt, their sources must arise amidst these hills; and the direction
they run in, for a considerable distance, must be either due north, or
due south. For it is strikingly singular that three such noble harbours
as Botany Bay, Port Jackson, and Broken Bay, alike end in shallows and
swamps, filled with mangroves.

The general face of the country is certainly pleasing, being diversified
with gentle ascents, and little winding vallies, covered for the most
part with large spreading trees, which afford a succession of leaves
in all seasons. In those places where trees are scarce, a variety of
flowering shrubs abound, most of them entirely new to an European,
and surpassing in beauty, fragrance, and number, all I ever saw in an
uncultivated state: among these, a tall shrub, bearing an elegant white
flower, which smells like English May, is particularly delightful, and
perfumes the air around to a great distance. The species of trees are
few, and, I am concerned to add, the wood universally of so bad a grain,
as almost to preclude a possibility of using it: the increase of labour
occasioned by this in our buildings has been such, as nearly to exceed
belief. These trees yield a profusion of thick red gum (not unlike the
'sanguis draconis') which is found serviceable in medicine, particularly
in dysenteric complaints, where it has sometimes succeeded, when all
other preparations have failed. To blunt its acrid qualities, it is
usual to combine it with opiates.

The nature of the soil is various. That immediately round Sydney Cove is
sandy, with here and there a stratum of clay. From the sand we have yet
been able to draw very little; but there seems no reason to doubt, that
many large tracts of land around us will bring to perfection whatever
shall be sown in them. To give this matter a fair trial, some practical
farmers capable of such an undertaking should be sent out; for the spots
we have chosen for experiments in agriculture, in which we can scarce
be supposed adepts, have hitherto but ill repaid our toil, which may be
imputable to our having chosen such as are unfavourable for our purpose.

Except from the size of the trees, the difficulties of clearing the land
are not numerous, underwood being rarely found, though the country
is not absolutely without it. Of the natural meadows which Mr. Cook
mentions near Botany Bay, we can give no account; none such exist about
Port Jackson. Grass, however, grows in every place but the swamps with
the greatest vigour and luxuriancy, though it is not of the finest
quality, and is found to agree better with horses and cows than sheep. A
few wild fruits are sometimes procured, among which is the small purple
apple mentioned by Cook, and a fruit which has the appearance of a
grape, though in taste more like a green gooseberry, being excessively
sour: probably were it meliorated by cultivation, it would become more
palatable.

Fresh water, as I have said before, is found but in inconsiderable
quantities. For the common purposes of life there is generally enough;
but we know of no stream in the country capable of turning a mill: and
the remark made by Mr. Anderson, of the dryness of the country round
Adventure Bay, extends without exception to every part of it which we
have penetrated.

Previous to leaving England I remember to have frequently heard it
asserted, that the discovery of mines was one of the secondary objects
of the expedition. Perhaps there are mines; but as no person competent
to form a decision is to be found among us, I wish no one to adopt an
idea, that I mean to impress him with such a belief, when I state, that
individuals, whose judgements are not despicable, are willing to think
favourably of this conjecture, from specimens of ore seen in many of the
stones picked up here. I cannot quit this subject without regretting,
that some one capable of throwing a better light on it, is not in the
colony. Nor can I help being equally concerned, that an experienced
botanist was not sent out, for the purpose of collecting and describing
the rare and beautiful plants with which the country abounds. Indeed,
we flattered ourselves, when at the Cape of Good Hope, that Mason, the
King's botanical gardener, who was employed there in collecting for the
royal nursery at Kew, would have joined us, but it seems his orders and
engagements prevented him from quitting that beaten track, to enter on
this scene of novelty and variety.

To the naturalist this country holds out many invitations. Birds, though
not remarkably numerous, are in great variety, and of the most exquisite
beauty of plumage, among which are the cockatoo, lory, and parroquet;
but the bird which principally claims attention is, a species of
ostrich, approaching nearer to the emu of South America than any other
we know of. One of them was shot, at a considerable distance, with a
single ball, by a convict employed for that purpose by the Governor; its
weight, when complete, was seventy pounds, and its length from the end
of the toe to the tip of the beak, seven feet two inches, though there
was reason to believe it had not attained its full growth. On dissection
many anatomical singularities were observed: the gall-bladder was
remarkably large, the liver not bigger than that of a barn-door fowl,
and after the strictest search no gizzard could be found; the legs,
which were of a vast length, were covered with thick, strong scales,
plainly indicating the animal to be formed for living amidst deserts;
and the foot differed from an ostrich's by forming a triangle, instead
of being cloven.

Goldsmith, whose account of the emu is the only one I can refer to,
says, "that it is covered from the back and rump with long feathers,
which fall backward, and cover the anus; these feathers are grey on
the back, and white on the belly." The wings are so small as hardly to
deserve the name, and are unfurnished with those beautiful ornaments
which adorn the wings of the ostrich: all the feathers are extremely
coarse, but the construction of them deserves notice--they grow in pairs
from a single shaft, a singularity which the author I have quoted has
omitted to remark. It may be presumed, that these birds are not very
scarce, as several have been seen, some of them immensely large, but
they are so wild, as to make shooting them a matter of great difficulty.
Though incapable of flying, they run with such swiftness, that our
fleetest greyhounds are left far behind in every attempt to catch them.
The flesh was eaten, and tasted like beef.

Besides the emu, many birds of prodigious size have been seen, which
promise to increase the number of those described by naturalists,
whenever we shall be fortunate enough to obtain them; but among these
the bat of the Endeavour River is not to be found. In the woods are
various little songsters, whose notes are equally sweet and plaintive.

Of quadrupeds, except the kangaroo, I have little to say. The few met
with are almost invariably of the opossum tribe, but even these do not
abound. To beasts of prey we are utter strangers, nor have we yet any
cause to believe that they exist in the country. And happy it is for us
that they do not, as their presence would deprive us of the only fresh
meals the settlement affords, the flesh of the kangaroo. This singular
animal is already known in Europe by the drawing and description of Mr.
Cook. To the drawing nothing can be objected but the position of the
claws of the hinder leg, which are mixed together like those of a
dog, whereas no such indistinctness is to be found in the animal I am
describing. It was the Chevalier De Perrouse who pointed out this to me,
while we were comparing a kangaroo with the plate, which, as he justly
observed, is correct enough to give the world in general a good idea of
the animal, but not sufficiently accurate for the man of science.

Of the natural history of the kangaroo we are still very ignorant.
We may, however, venture to pronounce this animal, a new species of
opossum, the female being furnished with a bag, in which the young is
contained; and in which the teats are found. These last are only two in
number, a strong presumptive proof, had we no other evidence, that
the kangaroo brings forth rarely more than one at a birth. But this
is settled beyond a doubt, from more than a dozen females having
been killed, which had invariably but one formed in the pouch.
Notwithstanding this, the animal may be looked on as prolific, from the
early age it begins to breed at, kangaroos with young having been taken
of not more than thirty pounds weight; and there is room to believe that
when at their utmost growth, they weigh not less than one hundred and
fifty pounds. A male of one hundred and thirty pounds weight has been
killed, whose dimensions were as follows:

     ------------------------------------------------------------------
                                             Feet.             Inches.
     Extreme length                            7                  3
     Ditt of the tail                          3                  4 1/2
     Ditto of the hinder legs                  3                  2
     Ditto of the fore paws                    1                  7 1/2
     Circumference of the tail of the root     1                  5
     ------------------------------------------------------------------

After this perhaps I shall hardly be credited, when I affirm that the
kangaroo on being brought forth is not larger than an English mouse.
It is, however, in my power to speak positively on this head, as I have
seen more than one instance of it.

In running, this animal confines himself entirely to his hinder, legs,
which are possessed with an extraordinary muscular power. Their speed
is very great, though not in general quite equal to that of a greyhound;
but when the greyhounds are so fortunate as to seize them, they are
incapable of retaining their hold, from the amazing struggles of the
animal. The bound of the kangaroo, when not hard pressed, has been
measured, and found to exceed twenty feet.

At what time of the year they copulate, and in what manner, we know
not: the testicles of the male are placed contrary to the usual order of
nature.

When young the kangaroo eats tender and well flavoured, tasting like
veal, but the old ones are more tough and stringy than bullbeef. They
are not carnivorous, and subsist altogether on particular flowers and
grass. Their bleat is mournful, and very different from that of any
other animal: it is, however, seldom heard but in the young ones.

Fish, which our sanguine hopes led us to expect in great quantities, do
not abound. In summer they are tolerably plentiful, but for some months
past very few have been taken. Botany Bay in this respect exceeds Port
Jackson. The French once caught near two thousand fish in one day, of
a species of grouper, to which, from the form of a bone in the head
resembling a helmet, we have given the name of light horseman. To this
may be added bass, mullets, skait, soles, leather-jackets, and many
other species, all so good in their kind, as to double our regret at
their not being more numerous. Sharks of an enormous size are found
here. One of these was caught by the people on board the Sirius, which
measured at the shoulders six feet and a half in circumference. His
liver yielded twenty-four gallons of oil; and in his stomach was found
the head of a shark, which had been thrown overboard from the same ship.
The Indians, probably from having felt the effects of their voracious
fury, testify the utmost horror on seeing these terrible fish.

Venomous animals and reptiles are rarely seen. Large snakes beautifully
variegated have been killed, but of the effect of their bites we are
happily ignorant. Insects, though numerous, are by no means, even in
summer, so troublesome as I have found them in America, the West Indies,
and other countries.

The climate is undoubtedly very desirable to live in. In summer the
heats are usually moderated by the sea breeze, which sets in early;
and in winter the degree of cold is so slight as to occasion no
inconvenience; once or twice we have had hoar frosts and hail, but
no appearance of snow. The thermometer has never risen beyond 84, nor
fallen lower than 35, in general it stood in the beginning of February
at between 78 and 74 at noon. Nor is the temperature of the air less
healthy than pleasant. Those dreadful putrid fevers by which new
countries are so often ravaged, are unknown to us: and excepting a
slight diarrhoea, which prevailed soon after we had landed, and was
fatal in very few instances, we are strangers to epidemic diseases.

On the whole, (thunder storms in the hot months excepted) I know not any
climate equal to this I write in. Ere we had been a fortnight on shore
we experienced some storms of thunder accompanied with rain, than
which nothing can be conceived more violent and tremendous, and their
repetition for several days, joined to the damage they did, by killing
several of our sheep, led us to draw presages of an unpleasant
nature. Happily, however, for many months we have escaped any similar
visitations.




CHAPTER XVI.



The Progress made in the Settlement; and the Situation of Affairs at the
Time of the Ship, which conveys this Account, sailing for England.


For the purpose of expediting the public work, the male convicts have
been divided into gangs, over each of which a person, selected from
among themselves, is placed. It is to be regretted that Government did
not take this matter into consideration before we left England, and
appoint proper persons with reasonable salaries to execute the office of
overseers; as the consequence of our present imperfect plan is such, as
to defeat in a great measure the purposes for which the prisoners were
sent out. The female convicts have hitherto lived in a state of total
idleness; except a few who are kept at work in making pegs for tiles,
and picking up shells for burning into lime. For the last time I repeat,
that the behaviour of all classes of these people since our arrival in
the settlement has been better than could, I think, have been expected
from them.

Temporary wooden storehouses covered with thatch or shingles, in which
the cargoes of all the ships have been lodged, are completed; and
an hospital is erected. Barracks for the military are considerably
advanced; and little huts to serve, until something more permanent can
be finished, have been raised on all sides. Notwithstanding this the
encampments of the marines and convicts are still kept up; and to
secure their owners from the coldness of the nights, are covered in with
bushes, and thatched over.

The plan of a town I have already said is marked out. And as freestone
of an excellent quality abounds, one requisite towards the completion
of it is attained. Only two houses of stone are yet begun, which are
intended for the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. One of the greatest
impediments we meet with is a want of limestone, of which no signs
appear. Clay for making bricks is in plenty, and a considerable quantity
of them burned and ready for use.

In enumerating the public buildings I find I have been so remiss as
to omit an observatory, which is erected at a small distance from
the encampments. It is nearly completed, and when fitted up with the
telescopes and other astronomical instruments sent out by the Board of
Longitude, will afford a desirable retreat from the listlessness of a
camp evening at Port Jackson. One of the principal reasons which induced
the Board to grant this apparatus was, for the purpose of enabling
Lieutenant Dawes, of the marines, (to whose care it is intrusted) to
make observations on a comet which is shortly expected to appear in the
southern hemisphere. The latitude of the observatory, from the result of
more than three hundred observations, is fixed at 33 deg 52 min 30 sec
south, and the longitude at 151 deg 16 min 30 sec east of Greenwich. The
latitude of the south head which forms the entrance of the harbour, 33
deg 51 min, and that of the north head opposite to it at 33 deg 49 min
45 sec south.

Since landing here our military force has suffered a diminution of only
three persons, a serjeant and two privates. Of the convicts fifty-four
have perished, including the executions. Amidst the causes of this
mortality, excessive toil and a scarcity of food are not to be numbered,
as the reader will easily conceive, when informed, that they have
the same allowance of provisions as every officer and soldier in the
garrison; and are indulged by being exempted from labour every Saturday
afternoon and Sunday. On the latter of those days they are expected
to attend divine service, which is performed either within one of the
storehouses, or under a great tree in the open air, until a church can
be built.

Amidst our public labours, that no fortified post, or place of security,
is yet begun, may be a matter of surprise. Were an emergency in the
night to happen, it is not easy to say what might not take place before
troops, scattered about in an extensive encampment, could be formed, so
as to act. An event that happened a few evenings since may, perhaps, be
the means of forwarding this necessary work. In the dead of night the
centinels on the eastern side of the cove were alarmed by the voices
of the Indians, talking near their posts. The soldiers on this occasion
acted with their usual firmness, and without creating a disturbance,
acquainted the officer of the guard with the circumstance, who
immediately took every precaution to prevent an attack, and at the same
time gave orders that no molestation, while they continued peaceable,
should be offered them. From the darkness of the night, and the distance
they kept at, it was not easy to ascertain their number, but from the
sound of the voices and other circumstances, it was calculated at near
thirty. To their intentions in honouring us with this visit (the only
one we have had from them in the last five months) we are strangers,
though most probably it was either with a view to pilfer, or to
ascertain in what security we slept, and the precautions we used in the
night. When the bells of the ships in the harbour struck the hour of the
night, and the centinels called out on their posts "All's well," they
observed a dead silence, and continued it for some minutes, though
talking with the greatest earnestness and vociferation but the moment
before. After having remained a considerable time they departed without
interchanging a syllable with our people.




CHAPTER XVII.



Some Thoughts on the Advantages which may arise to the Mother Country
from forming the Colony.


The author of these sheets would subject himself to the charge of
presumption, were he to aim at developing the intentions of Government
in forming this settlement. But without giving offence, or incurring
reproach, he hopes his opinion on the probability of advantage to be
drawn from hence by Great Britain, may be fairly made known.

If only a receptacle for convicts be intended, this place stands
unequalled from the situation, extent, and nature of the country. When
viewed in a commercial light, I fear its insignificance will appear very
striking. The New Zealand hemp, of which so many sanguine expectations
were formed, is not a native of the soil; and Norfolk Island, where we
made sure to find this article, is also without it. So that the scheme
of being able to assist the East Indies with naval stores, in case of a
war, must fall to the ground, both from this deficiency, and the quality
of the timber growing here. Were it indeed possible to transport that of
Norfolk Island, its value would be found very great, but the difficulty,
from the surf, I am well informed, is so insuperable as to forbid
the attempt. Lord Howe Island, discovered by Lieut. Ball, though an
inestimable acquisition to our colony, produces little else than the
mountain cabbage tree.

Should a sufficient military force be sent out to those employed in
cultivating the ground, I see no room to doubt, that in the course of
a few years, the country will be able to yield grain enough for the
support of its new possessors. But to effect this, our present limits
must be greatly extended, which will require detachments of troops not
to be spared from the present establishment. And admitting the position,
the parent country will still have to supply us for a much longer time
with every other necessary of life. For after what we have seen, the
idea of being soon able to breed cattle sufficient for our consumption,
must appear chimerical and absurd. From all which it is evident, that
should Great Britain neglect to send out regular supplies, the most
fatal consequences will ensue.

Speculators who may feel inclined to try their fortunes here, will do
well to weigh what I have said. If golden dreams of commerce and wealth
flatter their imaginations, disappointment will follow: the remoteness
of situation, productions of the country, and want of connection with
other parts of the world, justify me in the assertion. But to men of
small property, unambitious of trade, and wishing for retirement, I
think the continent of New South Wales not without inducements. One
of this description, with letters of recommendation, and a sufficient
capital (after having provided for his passage hither) to furnish him
with an assortment of tools for clearing land, agricultural and domestic
purposes; possessed also of a few household utensils, a cow, a few sheep
and breeding sows, would, I am of opinion, with proper protection and
encouragement, succeed in obtaining a comfortable livelihood, were he
well assured before he quitted his native country, that a provision for
him until he might be settled, should be secured; and that a grant of
land on his arrival would be allotted him.

That this adventurer, if of a persevering character and competent
knowledge, might in the course of ten years bring matters into such a
train as to render himself comfortable and independent, I think highly
probable. The superfluities of his farm would enable him to purchase
European commodities from the masters of ships, which will arrive on
Government account, sufficient to supply his wants. But beyond this he
ought not to reckon, for admitting that he might meet with success in
raising tobacco, rice, indigo, or vineyards (for which last I think the
soil and climate admirably adapted), the distance of a mart to vend them
at, would make the expense of transportation so excessive, as to cut off
all hopes of a reasonable profit; nor can there be consumers enough here
to take them off his hands, for so great a length of time to come, as I
shall not be at the trouble of computing.

Should then any one, induced by this account, emigrate hither, let him,
before he quits England, provide all his wearing apparel for himself,
family, and servants; his furniture, tools of every kind, and implements
of husbandry (among which a plough need not be included, as we make use
of the hoe), for he will touch at no place where they can be purchased
to advantage. If his sheep and hogs are English also, it will be better.
For wines, spirits, tobacco, sugar, coffee, tea, rice, poultry, and many
other articles, he may venture to rely on at Teneriffe or Madeira, the
Brazils and Cape of Good Hope. It will not be his interest to draw bills
on his voyage out, as the exchange of money will be found invariably
against him, and a large discount also deducted. Drafts on the place he
is to touch at, or cash (dollars if possible) will best answer his end.

To men of desperate fortune and the lowest classes of the people, unless
they can procure a passage as indented servants, similar to the custom
practised of emigrating to America, this part of the world offers no
temptation: for it can hardly be supposed, that Government will be fond
of maintaining them here until they can be settled, and without such
support they must starve.

Of the Governor's instructions and intentions relative to the disposal
of the convicts, when the term of their transportation shall be expired,
I am ignorant. They will then be free men, and at liberty, I apprehend,
either to settle in the country, or to return to Europe. The former
will be attended with some public expense; and the latter, except in
particular cases, will be difficult to accomplish, from the numberless
causes which prevent a frequent communication between England and this
continent.




POSTSCRIPT



Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, New South Wales.


October 1st, 1788. Little material has occurred in this colony since the
departure of the ships for England, on the 14th July last. On the
20th of that month His Majesty's ship Supply, Captain Ball, sailed
for Norfolk Island, and returned on the 26th August. Our accounts from
thence are more favourable than were expected. The soil proves admirably
adapted to produce all kinds of grain, and European vegetables. But the
discovery which constitutes its value is the New Zealand flax, plants
of which are found growing in every part of the island in the utmost
luxuriancy and abundance. This will, beyond doubt, appear strange to the
reader after what has been related in the former part of my work: and
in future, let the credit of the testimony be as high as it may, I
shall never without diffidence and hesitation presume to contradict
the narrations of Mr. Cook. The truth is, that those sent to settle and
explore the island knew not the form in which the plant grows, and were
unfurnished with every particular which could lead to a knowledge of
it. Unaccountable as this may sound, it is, nevertheless, incontestably
true. Captain Ball brought away with him several specimens for
inspection, and, on trial, by some flax-dressers among us, the threads
produced from them, though coarse, are pronounced to be stronger, more
likely to be durable, and fitter for every purpose of manufacturing
cordage, than any they ever before dressed.

Every research has been made by those on the island to find a
landing-place, whence it might be practicable to ship off the timber
growing there, but hitherto none has been discovered. A plan, however,
for making one has been laid before the Governor, and is at present
under consideration, though (in the opinion of many here) it is not such
an one as will be found to answer the end proposed.

Lieut. King and his little garrison were well when the 'Supply' left
them: but I am sorry to add, that, from casualties, their number is
already five less than it originally was. A ship from hence is ready to
sail with an increase of force, besides many convicts for the purpose of
sawing up timber, and turning the flax-plant to advantage.

So much for Norfolk. In Port Jackson all is quiet and stupid as could be
wished. We generally hear the lie of the day as soon as the beating
of the Reveille announces the return of it; find it contradicted by
breakfast time; and pursue a second through all its varieties, until
night, welcome as to a lover, gives us to sleep and dream ourselves
transported to happier climes.

Let me not, however, neglect telling you the little news which presents
itself. All descriptions of men enjoy the highest state of health; and
the convicts continue to behave extremely well. A gang of one hundred of
them, guarded by a captain, two subalterns and 20 marines, is about to
be sent up to the head of the harbour, at the distance of 3 leagues, in
a westerly direction, from Sydney Cove, for the purpose of establishing
a settlement there. The convicts are to be employed in putting the land
around into cultivation, as it appears to be of a more promising nature
than that near the encampment. Indeed this last hitherto succeeds but
very indifferently, though I do not yet despair, that when good seeds
can be procured, our toil will be better rewarded. But as this is an
event at a distance, and in itself very precarious, Governor Phillip has
determined on procuring a supply of flour and other necessaries from the
Cape of Good Hope, as our stock on hand is found to be, on examination,
not quite so ample as had been reckoned upon. To execute this purpose
his Excellency has ordered the Sirius to prepare for the voyage; by
which conveyance the opportunity of writing to you is afforded me. It
was at first intended to dispatch the Sirius to some of the neighbouring
islands (the Friendly or Society) in the Pacific Ocean, to procure stock
there, but the uselessness of the scheme, joined to the situation
of matters here, has, happily for us, prevented its being put into
execution.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
